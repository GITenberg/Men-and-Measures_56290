</div>

<p class='c009'>This history is the development of a short story
of the Imperial System of Weights and Measures published
eleven years ago, but withdrawn when this
fuller work took shape. To have made it at all complete
would have required a long lifetime of research;
to give and discuss every authority, to trace, even to
acknowledge, every source of information would have
unduly swollen the volume and slackened the interest
of the narrative. I offer it with all its shortcomings
as an attempt to show the metric instincts of man
everywhere and in all time, to trace the origins and
evolution of the main national systems, to explain
the apparently arbitrary changes which have affected
them, to show how the ancient system used by the
English-speaking peoples of the world has been able,
not only to survive dangerous perturbations in the
past, but also to resist the modern revolutionary
system which has destroyed so many others less
homogeneous, less capable of adaptation to circumstances.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The earliest measures were those of length, and they
were derived from the rough-and-ready standard
afforded by the limbs of man.</p>

<p class='c014'>The readiest of these measures were those offered
by the length of the forearm, and by parts of the
hand; these formed a natural series of far-reaching
importance.</p>

<p class='c014'>These arm-measures were—</p>

<p class='c014'>1. The Cubit, the length of the bent forearm from
elbow-point to finger-tip, about 18 to 19 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. The Span, the length that can be spanned between
the thumb-tip and little finger-tip of the outstretched
hand. It is nearly half of the cubit, about 9 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The Palm, the breadth of the four fingers, one-third
of the span, one-sixth of the cubit, about 3 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. The Digit or finger-breadth at about the middle
of the middle finger, one-twelfth of the span, one-twenty-fourth
of the cubit = 3/4 inch.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>From this division of the cubit into 6 palms and
24 digits, and of its half, the span, into 12 digits,
came the division of the day into watches and hours,
of the year into months; came also the consecration
of the number 12 in legend, history, and social institutions—came
in short duodecimalism wherever we
find it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Add to the above measures the outstretch of the
arms, the fathom, we have the five primitive limb-lengths.</p>

<p class='c014'>A time came when civilisation required the fixing
of a standard cubit. It was perhaps at first an arbitrary
standard, but it became fixed by law in the most
ancient Eastern Kingdoms and, about the fortieth
century before the Christian era, perhaps much earlier,
certainly by the time of the Egyptian fourth dynasty,
it had been fixed at a length known for certain to be
equal to 18·24 English inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was no arbitrary standard, any more than
that of the English yard or the French metre. I may
say that, apart from parochial varieties and convenient
trade-units, always referable to some recognised
standard, there are no arbitrary standards in any
country; all have a directly scientific basis or a lineage
reaching, perhaps far back, to a scientific basis. They
may have deviated, by carelessness, or even by petty
fraud, from some accepted standard, but wholesale
trade has always been a conservator of standards.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is not the slightest doubt that the common
cubit of ancient Egypt, brought probably from Chaldæa,
was deduced from the measurement of the earth, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the quarter-meridian distance between the pole and
the equator. There are no written records of this
measurement; but an imperishable monument remained
to record it, and other ancient monuments
still remain to corroborate this testimony. The base
of the Great Pyramid was, from ancient times, always
known to be 500 cubits long on each side, and it is
found to be exactly half a meridian mile, or 500
Egyptian fathoms, in perimeter.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is no doubt that the wise men of the ancient
Eastern Kingdoms had great astronomical knowledge
and were capable of making the necessary meridian
measurement.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bailly (author of ‘Histoire de l’Astronomie,’ 1775-1787)
wrote:</p>

<p class='c015'>The measurement of the earth was undertaken a vast
number of ages ago in the times of primitive astronomy....
We pass contemptuously by the results of ancient
astronomical observations; we substitute others and, as
we perfect these, we find the same results that we had
despised.</p>

<p class='c014'>It will be seen that these ancient observations were
of great accuracy, and that modern science cannot
improve much on the measurements of the meridian
that were made on the plains of Chaldæa, or along the
Nile, at least sixty centuries ago.</p>

<p class='c014'>The unit of distance used at the present day by
seamen of all nations, the meridian mile, one-sixtieth
of a degree, is exactly 1000 Egyptian fathoms, or
4000 Egyptian meridian cubits, and the Great Pyramid
was built with a base measuring exactly 500 of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>cubits along each side and 500 of these fathoms in
perimeter.</p>

<p class='c014'>It had probably been found convenient before that
time to take a shorter unit than the cubit for use in
many everyday measurements. It was two-thirds
of the cubit, one-sixth of the fathom, and was called
a Foot from its being roughly about the length of a long
human foot. Apparently one of the primitive limb-measures,
it is really an outcome of the cubit, ‘foot’
being merely a convenient name for it. The foot of
the meridian cubit was of 4 palms or 16 digits and was
= 12·16 English inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Egyptian standards of linear measure, thus
adjusted to the meridian mile, passed to Greece, and
under the name of ‘Olympic’ became the Greek
standards of length.</p>

<p class='c014'>The use of the cubit and foot series of measures
is seen in Hesiod (ninth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>):</p>

<p class='c015'>Hew a mortar three feet (<i>tripodīn</i>) in diameter, and a
pestle three cubits (<i>tripichtēn</i>), and an axletree seven feet
(<i>heptapodīn</i>) ... and hew a wheel of three spans (<i>trispithamon</i>)
for the plough-carriage of ten palms (<i>dekadōro</i>)
length.</p>

<p class='c014'>Besides the original division of the foot into 16
finger-breadths or digits, there arose an alternative
division into 12 thumb-breadths or inches. So for
the Roman foot, of shorter standard than the Egyptian
or Olympic foot from which it was derived—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Pes habet palmos iv, uncias xij, digitos xvi,</div>
      <div class='line'>Palmus habet digitos iv, uncias iij.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>It may be said that with the foot originated the
sexdecimal system, as with the span the duodecimal
system. But the foot had as many inches, twelve, as
the span had of digits; and this division was the
same in other feet or spans not differing much from
the Olympic standard.</p>

<p class='c014'>The popularity of the foot, its general adoption
for the common purposes of life, are due to its being
divided into either 12 inches or 16 digits, the familiar
thumb-breadths and finger-breadths. Every popular
system meeting the convenience and the ways of thought
of men and women, must have its measures of length
approximately coinciding with the familiar units of
limb-lengths, and it must be divided sexdecimally
or duodecimally to enable people, men, women and
children, to calculate mentally in the everyday business
of life.</p>

<p class='c014'>The octonary or semi-sexdecimal mode of division
seen in our Pint-Gallon-Bushel series is also very
convenient, especially for measures of capacity and
for land-measures, admitting extensive halving and
quartering with subordinate units at each division.
Duodecimal division having the convenience of thirding
is convenient for the coinage series. A combination
of the score and dozen series, as in our money-pound
of 20 × 12 pence, combines the advantages of extensive
halving and thirding.</p>

<p class='c014'>But never has man taken to a decimal series of
weights and measures; he may use them on compulsion,
and then will evade them whenever he can. He
has ten fingers, whence decimal numeration from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>earliest times; but he has always rejected decimal
measures.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>If to the inconvenience of not being able to halve
a unit more than once (and that only as a concession
to unscientific weakness of mind), so that there is an
interval of ten units between each named unit of the
series, be added that the familiar units of common life,
the thumb-breadth, the span, the foot, the pound, the
pint, have no representatives in a decimal system,
then no cajolery of science or patriotism will persuade
men and women to use the system, except under
police compulsion, and every trick will be used to
evade it. Such are the ways of the human mind.
Systems that are suited to popular convenience, both
in wholesale and retail trade; systems that admit of
modification and improvement—these will live. Systems
imposed by police-force in which the people must
fit themselves to the system—these are bound to fail.</p>

<p class='c014'>The convenient foot being taken as subsidiary to
the cubit, it afforded, for long measurements, larger
units which harmonised with the cubit, and with its
half, the span. The most usual long unit has been the
Fathom and its double—</p>

<p class='c014'>This Rod, varying according to the local standard
of the foot or the span, is that nearly always used
in countries round the Mediterranean. In northern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>countries where the foot has superseded the span for
measures of any length, 16 feet instead of 16 spans is
a usual length for the rod-measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a curious fact in the history of human nature
that neither ancient Egypt nor the other Eastern
monarchies kept to the meridian cubit and the measures
based on it. While it survived in Greece, it was
abandoned, officially at least, in Egypt, Assyria, and
Persia. Influences in which science was mixed with
astrolatry caused a second cubit to arise, even at the
time of the building of the Great Pyramid, and this
cubit superseded the meridian cubit as the official
standard of the Eastern Kingdoms. Centuries passed
and other cubits, not many, five or six at the most,
arose through analogous influences. From these Eastern
cubits, and from the Roman linear measures based
on a mile eight-tenths of the meridian mile, all the
various systems of the civilised world have been evolved.</p>

<p class='c014'>From linear measures, the fathom and the rod,
came measures of surface which, quickly in some
countries, slowly in others, superseded more primitive
estimates of cultivated area. A very usual unit of
land-length and of road-distance was the customary
length of the furrow. In all times and countries the
peasant has found that a certain length of furrow,
often about 100 fathoms or 50 rods, was convenient
for himself and his plough-cattle. A strip of land of
this length, and of one or more rods in breadth, would
become a unit of field-measurement, and in time this
superficial extent, in some shape or other, would
become a geometrical standard.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Commerce, even of the most primitive kind, led to
two other forms of measure—to Weight and Capacity.
The capacity of the two hands, that of a customary
basket or pot, that of the bottomed cylinder obtained
from a segment of well-grown bamboo, would be
superseded by that of a vessel containing a certain
weight of corn, oil or wine, as soon as the goldsmith
had devised the balance. Seeds of generally constant
weight such as those of the locust-tree, used for weighing
the precious metals, would soon be supplemented
by a larger standard for heavier weighing; and the
weight of a cubic span or a cubic foot of water would
afford a suitable unit. A vessel containing a cubic
foot of water thus afforded a standard, the Eastern
Talent, both for weight and for capacity. The cubic
foot would become a standard for the measure of oil
or wine, while this measure increased, usually by 22
or 25 per cent., so as to contain a talent-weight of corn,
generally of wheat, would become the Bushel or otherwise-named
standard of capacity, for the peasant and
for corn-dealers.</p>

<p class='c014'>The peasant would use his bushel not only to
measure his corn, but also to estimate his land according
to the measure of seed-corn it required. He would
also take a day’s ploughing on a customary length
of furrow, as a rough measure of surface, and the
landlord would estimate the extent of his property by
the number of yoke of plough-cattle required to work
it. These seed-units and plough-units would in time
be fixed, and thus become the basis of agrarian measures.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the meantime coinage would have arisen. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>subdivision of the talent would become the pound
or common unit of weight in the retail market, and a
subdivision of the pound would be fixed as the weight
of silver which, impressed with signs guaranteeing its
fineness, if not its actual weight, would be the currency
of the merchants.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then arose, by involution, another system of
weights in which the pound was usually of 12 or 16
ounces, and the ounce was the weight of so many
standard coins. Every modern pound was based on
this system. But again, the pound of silver would
yield a certain number of coins, giving rise to a new
monetary system under which the coin-origin of the
pound would in time be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c014'>The necessary state-privilege of coining money
sometimes led to differences between mint-weight
and commercial weight. Just as there arose in the
ancient East a royal or sacred cubit different from that
in vulgar use, so there arose in many countries a royal
pound used in the mint and different from the vulgar
commercial weight. In many countries, ancient and
modern, the mint has kept up systems of weight consecrated
by tradition but obsolete for all other uses,
and out of harmony with commercial weight.</p>

<p class='c014'>The scientific measurement of time had early been
established by the astronomers who had measured the
meridian.</p>

<p class='c014'>The skilled artisans who constructed astronomical
instruments and the standard measures of capacity
and weight must have observed that the water contained
in the standard measure of capacity weighed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>more when it was as cold as possible than when at the
temperature of an Eastern summer; they could not
fail to develop the idea of thermometry thus made
evident to them. Nor could anyone fail to see that
oil was lighter than water, strong wine than unfermented,
and spring-water than brine or sweet juices.
Some means of aræometry, by an immersed rod or
bead, would be devised to avoid the trouble of finding
their density by the balance.</p>

<p class='c014'>It may thus be said that the scientists and skilled
artisans of very ancient Eastern lands were fully as
capable of constructing a scientific system of weights
and measures as Western Europeans in our eighteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c014'>Good systems were carried by commerce to less
advanced countries; if convenient they took root,
partially or entirely, and, with such modifications as
circumstances caused or required, they spread and
were in due time given legal sanction.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such is the usual course of evolution in the formation
of a system of weights and measures from a linear
measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>A modification of the original linear standard may
lead to the evolution of a new system. Thus, when
the Romans took as their foot 1/5000 of a short mile of
8 Olympic stadia instead of 1/6000 of the meridian mile
of 10 stadia, this new foot was the starting point of a
new system.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another process of evolution, or rather of involution,
may occur from an imported standard of capacity.
Supposing that trade has carried a certain measure to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>a country which it supplies with corn, and that this
measure has been adopted, with divisions convenient
to the people: from this corn-measure another
measure, about 4/5 of it, may be constructed, containing
the same weight of wine or water that the former
contains of corn; here will be a standard fluid measure,
and perhaps some fraction of it filled with water may
be taken as a standard of weight. Let now some
cubical vessel be constructed to hold exactly the
standard measure of water; the length or breadth of
each side will give a linear unit which, if it approximate
sufficiently with a foot or span to which the people
are accustomed, will offer a fixed linear standard in
harmony with the other standards. Thus, from a convenient
foreign unit of capacity or of weight, a new
and complete system of national measures may be
constructed by involution.</p>

<p class='c014'>It will be seen that several cases of such involution
have happened. There is indeed no documentary
evidence for them, and often very little for the more
usual processes of evolution. But the evidence for
the origin of most weights and measures is entirely
circumstantial; it is by the study of metrology,
founded on research into the systems of different
countries, that the student is able to weigh circumstantial
evidence, to use it prudently, to guard himself
against mere coincidence, to clear away legend, to
examine documentary evidence carefully, to read
between the lines of records, often very deceptive
if he come to them unprepared.</p>

<p class='c014'>The various systems which have developed by these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>processes, generally of evolution, but sometimes of
involution, lose the appearance of Babel-confusion
they had before their development could be explained
otherwise than by fanciful legend or despotic caprice.
But once the right point of view is found, unity is seen
in the hitherto bewildering variety, and the trend of the
human mind is seen to be regular in the systems that
it evolves, in its way of meeting difficulties, in its
acceptance of changes which are real improvements,
in its aversion to arbitrary changes, in its devices for
evading despotic interference with what it has found
convenient.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE STORY OF THE CUBITS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The story of the cubits and of the talents, the great
units of weight evolved from the cubits, is part of the
history of the ancient and medieval Eastern Kingdoms,
so intimately is it connected with their mutual relations,
with their astrolatric ideas, and with the influence of
those ideas on their science and art. This story,
extending over more than fifty centuries, from long
before the building of the Great Pyramid to near the
tenth century of our era, explains the evolution of all
weights and measures, ancient and modern.</p>

<p class='c014'>The standard of the cubits has come down to us in
great monuments, the measurements of which show
undoubted unity of standard, and ancient histories
and records often state the dimensions in the original
cubits or in other cubits. Sometimes the actual
wooden measures used by architects or masons are
still extant; sometimes weights known to have been
derived from these cubits either survive or can be
ascertained. Thus in various ways the original length
of the ancient cubits is known more accurately than
that of many modern standards of length.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>
  <h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>The Egyptian Common, or Olympic Cubit</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'>A certain record of this cubit remains in the Great
Pyramid. It is known to have measured 500 cubits
along each side of the base, 2000 cubits or 500 fathoms
being the perimeter of the base. The measurement
made by our Ordnance Surveyors gave 760 feet for
the side. The latest measurement, by Mr. Flinders
Petrie, is not quite 6 inches longer. Taking the Ordnance
Survey figure we have (760 × 12)/500 = 18·24 inches
as the length of the common cubit, and two-thirds of
this gives 12·16 inches for the common foot, or the
Olympic foot as it is called from the adoption of this
standard by the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c014'>This length, supported by measurements of other
ancient monuments, may be regarded as certain. Four
cubits or six Olympic feet were contained in the
Egypto-Greek orgyia or fathom, and this measure =
72·96 inches or 6·08 feet, is exactly one-thousandth of
the 6080 feet length of the Meridian or Nautical Mile.</p>

<p class='c014'>This cubit, common to the three great ancient
kingdoms, Babylonia, Egypt, and afterwards Assyria,
originated probably in Chaldæa, passing to Egypt with
the earliest civilisation of that country, and thence to
Greece. The name of Olympic thence attached to
this standard must not make us forget its origin.
The saying of Sir Henry Maine, ‘Except the blind
forces of nature, nothing moves in the world which
was not Greek in its origin,’ is not exact unless we
include as Greek the great kingdoms conquered by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Alexander, and which, under the Roman empire and
afterwards under the Saracen caliphates, continued to
have great influence over the civilisation of the West.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Meridian Mile</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>At least sixty centuries ago the Chaldæan astronomers
had divided the circumference of the earth,
and of circles generally, into 360 degrees (that is 6 × 60)
each of 60 parts. There is good reason to believe that
they, before the Egyptians, who had the same scientific
ideas, had already measured the terrestrial meridian
and determined the length of the mean degree and of
its sixtieth part, the meridian mile.</p>

<p class='c014'>Owing to the flattening of the globe towards its
poles, meridian degrees are not of equal lengths; they
increase in length from the equator, so that their
sixtieth parts are—</p>

</table>

<p class='c014'>The mean length is at about 49° N. where the
degree and mile are—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>69·091 statute miles; 1/60 = 6080 feet.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The perimeter of the base of the Great Pyramid is
exactly half of that length, i.e. 3040 feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>The length of the meridian mile, 1000 Olympic
fathoms = 4000 Olympic feet, was divided by the
Greek geometers (and probably by the Egyptians and
Chaldæans long before them) into 10 stadia, each of
100 fathoms = 600 Olympic feet = 608 feet, which is
about our present cable length. And the meridian or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>nautical mile, used by seamen of all nations, is this
same Egypto-Greek mile of 6080 feet = 2026-2/3 yards
= 1013-1/3 fathoms = 1·1515 statute miles. It is sometimes
put at 6082-2/3 feet. French geometers estimate
it at 1852·227 metres = 6076-3/4 feet, one ten-millionth
of the quarter-meridian being = 1·0002 metre. The
nautical mile is sometimes called a knot, in the sense
of a ship going so many nautical miles in an hour, as
ascertained by the number of knots of the log-line,
each 1/120 of a nautical mile or 50-2/3 feet, run out in half
a minute, 1/120 of an hour.</p>

<p class='c014'>The meridian mile must not be confounded with the
geographical or equatorial mile, 1/60 degree along the
equatorial circumference = 6087-1/3 feet.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Greek Itinerary Measures</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>Though a length of 10 stadia is a meridian mile,
neither the Egyptians nor the Greeks appear to have
used this mile as an itinerary measure. Herodotus
says:</p>

<p class='c015'>All men who are short of land measure it by Fathoms;
but those who are less short of it, by Stadia; and those
who have much, by Parasangs; and such as have a very
great extent, by Schoinoi. Now a Parasang is equal to
30 stadia, and each Schoinos, which is an Egyptian
measure, is equal to 60 stadia.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Parasang of 30 stadia was then 3 meridian
miles, the modern marine league, 1/20 of a degree.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Schoinos was probably common to Egypt and
to Chaldæa. The Chaldæans venerated the numbers
6, 60, 600, &amp;c., and their sexagesimal scale, making the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>year 6 × 60 + 5 days and the circle 6 × 60 degrees
each of 60 minutes, has prevailed. The Olympic or
Egyptian-Greek measures of distance were on this
scale, though land-measures were, officially at least,
on a decimal scale.</p>

</table>

<p class='c014'>Between the Stadion and the Schoinos there is a
long gap, but the Greeks, for whose small country the
Stadion was a convenient unit, used, when abroad, the
Persian Parasang of 3 meridian miles, = 1/7200 of the
meridian circumference.</p>

<p class='c014'>The rise of other cubits obscured the Olympic
series of measures. The Schoinos became absorbed in
the Parasang, and under the Roman domination it
became a measure of 32 stadia or 4 Roman miles. The
Stadion also came to vary; it was nearly always of
100 fathoms, but these might be fathoms of systems
varying from the Olympic. The slightly different
term Schoinion, meaning a rope or chain, was applied
to a measure of 10 fathoms.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Roman Mile</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The Romans took for their itinerary unit a length
of 8 Olympic stadia and, dividing it into 1000 paces
or double steps, called it a mille (mille passus)
or mile. The Roman mile and pace are therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>respectively four-fifths of the meridian mile and the
Olympic fathom—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>8/10 of 6080 ft. = 4864 ft. = 1621-1/3 yards.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The pace was divided into 5 feet.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1/5 of 4·864 ft. (or 58·368 inches) = 11·673 inches.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>There was in course of time some slight variation
in the length of the Roman foot. It has been calculated
at between 11·65 and 11·67 inches. The best value
appears to be that of Greaves at 11·664 inches, but
11·67 seems to me sufficiently accurate, and corresponding
better to other Roman measures.</p>

<p class='c014'>The pace was also divided into quarters (palmipes)
of a foot and a palm.</p>

<p class='c014'>The foot was divided into 16 digits or into 12 inches
(pollices). Roman dominion over Greece and Egypt
led to some modifications, probably local, in measures
of distance. There was a Roman schœnus of 4 miles,
and the mile was divided, sometimes into 10 Olympic
stadia, sometimes into 8 Pythic stadia of 500 feet
or 100 paces.</p>

<p class='c014'>It will be seen that the English mile was originally
5000 Roman feet, and then 5000 English feet, before
being fixed at its present length of 5280 feet or 1760
yards.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>The Egyptian Royal Cubit</span> (<i>c.</i> 4000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>)</h3>

<p class='c020'>The possession of a geodesic cubit, 1/4 of the fathom
which was 1/1000 of the meridian mile, did not satisfy
the astrolatric priesthood of Egypt. Under their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>influence another cubit, of 7 palms = 20·64 inches,
became the official measure of Egypt, and it was used
in the planning of the monuments, always excepting
the outside plan of the Great Pyramid.</p>

<p class='c014'>What could have been the reason for this change,
from the scientifically excellent and fairly convenient
common cubit to this less convenient length, and for
bringing the inconvenient number seven into the
divisions and making both palms and digits different
in length from those of the common cubit?</p>

<p class='c014'>No valid reason can be found other than the desire
to institute, by the side of the common cubit in which
the 6 palms and 24 digits corresponded to the watches
and hours of the day, a sacred cubit in which the 7
palms would correspond to the seven planets or to the
week of seven days, and the 28 digits to the vulgar
lunar month of four weeks of seven days.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Among us,
at the present day, astrology is far from being dead;
the days still bear the names of the seven planets
ruling successively the first hour of the days named
respectively after them; we call, however unconsciously,
men’s temperaments or characters according
to the mercurial, jovial, saturnine and other influences
of the planets which rule the hour of birth. It is not
for us then to criticise severely the pious desire of a
learned priesthood or of a theocratic king to institute
a sacred standard of linear measure with divisions
corresponding in number to the seven planets which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>ruled the destinies of man, whose influence ruled
them through the Christian middle ages, which at the
present day still rule the world in the minds of the
great majority of mankind. The royal or sacred
cubit became the official cubit of the Eastern great
kingdoms, the common or meridian cubit being also
used, not only for ordinary purposes, but sometimes
along with it. Thus, the external dimensions of the
Great Pyramid are in common cubits, while the unit
of its internal dimensions is the royal cubit, perhaps
recently established at the time of the building.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a> And
centuries after the institution of the royal cubit, the
meridian cubit became the standard of the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c014'>The question naturally arises—Why was the royal
cubit not formed by simply adding a seventh palm to
the common cubit, a palm of the same length, = 3·04
inches, as the six others? This would have given a new
cubit of 18·24 × 7/6 = 21·28 inches, instead of 20·64
inches in 7 palms of 2·95 inches. And it will be seen
that this was actually done, fifty centuries later, by
the caliph Al-Mamūn.</p>

<p class='c014'>The answer I venture to give is, that the royal
cubit was intended to be, not only by its division a
homage to the seven planets, but also, by its increase
of length, a symbol of the proportion of latitude to
longitude at some Egyptian observatory.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Possibly it was a practical commemoration of the
art of determining longitude. On this hypothesis the
new cubit was made as much longer than the old
cubit as the mean degree of latitude is longer than
the degree of longitude in 29° N., at an observatory
about 50 meridian miles south of the Pyramids. In
that parallel, the proportion of the degree of longitude
to the degree of latitude is 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;1·13, or as 18·24 to
20·64.</p>

<p class='c014'>Measurements of monuments, both in Egypt and
in the Babylonian and Assyrian Kingdoms, show that
20·64 inches was the length of the royal cubit, and
actual cubit measures now extant do not vary from
it more than one-or two-hundredths of an inch. There
are at least ten of these cubits in museums and in
other collections. One, a double cubit, is in the British
Museum; another, very perfect, is in the Louvre;
another, of rough graduation, but accurate length, is in
the Liverpool Museum. There may be others, generally
unknown. I found one, apparently unrecorded, in the
museum of Avignon.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the Pyramids are very nearly in the same
parallel of latitude as the southern limits of Babylonia,
near Ur of the Chaldees, it is possible that the length
of the royal or sacred cubit may have been as acceptable
to the priesthood of Babylonia as that of Egypt.
This would account for the prevalence of the seven-palm
cubit throughout the Eastern great monarchies.
Perhaps the new cubit may have been instituted
internationally between the Bureau des Longitudes
of Egypt and that of Babylonia.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>As in the case of the common cubit, two-thirds of
the royal cubit were taken for the royal foot = 13·76
inches, a measure which when cubed will be seen to be
the source of our Imperial system of weights and
measures.</p>

<p class='c014'>The inconvenience of a cubit of 7 palms is increased
when two-thirds of it are taken for the foot; this foot,
being 4-2/3 palms or 18-2/3 digits, was possibly divided for
popular use into 16 digits, if it were ever in popular use.
For scientific and probably for popular use it appears to
have been divided into 2 feet = 10·32 inches. This
may be inferred from the division of the degrees,
attributed to Eratosthenes (third century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), into
700 stadia, each 600 of these feet. Probably 700 is
a round number, for, on the basis of this foot, the
degree would be 706·8 stadia.</p>

<p class='c014'>Three centuries later Pliny gave the base of the
Great Pyramid a length of 883 feet. The modern
measurement being 760 feet = 9120 inches, we have
9120/883 = 10·328 as the length of the foot in Pliny’s
account, a length differing by less than 1/100 inch from
that of the half-cubit.</p>

<p class='c014'>The investigations of Fréret, Jomard, Letronne
and other mathematicians led them to the conclusion
that the ancient Egyptians had surveyed their land
so exactly as to know its dimensions to a cubit near,
and that certainly at some unknown time they had
measured an arc of the meridian and established their
measures on the basis of the meridian degree with no
less exactness than has been done in modern times.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have put aside all attempts, often connected with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>theology, to show that the base of the Great Pyramid
was 220 double cubits (of 2 × 20·61 inches), the same
number as the yards in an Elizabethan furlong, or
that its other dimensions were intended to hand down
the English inch, or the gallon, or the squaring of the
circle, or the laws of harmonic progression.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>The Great Assyrian or Persian Cubit</span><br />(<i>c.</i> 700 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>)</h3>

<p class='c020'>The Egyptian idea of increasing the cubit appears
to have also seized the Assyrian monarchy many
centuries later. It was increased to 8 palms, as
different from those of the Egyptian royal cubit as
these were from those of the meridian cubit.</p>

<p class='c014'>This new measure is the cubit of Ezekiel, the
‘great cubit,’ the ‘cubit and a handbreadth,’ = 25·26
inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The same question as that presented by the increased
cubit of Egypt arises in the case of the Assyrian
cubit. What reason can be suggested for an increase
such as to again disturb the palm and the digit? The
advantage of having a standard of 8 palms divisible
into 2 feet of 4 palms, could have been obtained
far more simply and conveniently by adding an
eighth palm equal to the others, making it 23·6 inches,
with a half giving a foot = 11·8 inches. Or two palms
might have been added to the common cubit, making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>a new cubit = 24·32 inches, with the Olympic foot
as its half.</p>

<p class='c014'>I again venture a similar explanation. The increase
from the length of the Egyptian royal cubit corresponds
to the ratio of the degree of longitude to the degree of
latitude in 35·5° N., i.e. 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;1·224—</p>

<p class='c014'>This position was only 30 meridian miles from the
parallel of 36° N., a line which, passing through
Rhodes and Malta to the Straits of Gibraltar, was considered
by the ancient geographers as the first parallel
and was the base-line of their maps. It was called by
the Greek geographers the ‘diaphragm of the world.’<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>This line passing also a few miles south of Nineveh,
it is possible that some observatory near that capital
city, a few miles south of 36°, may have been the point
at which the difference in the lengths of the degrees of
longitude and of latitude was determined for the
standard length of the new cubit.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is an alternate hypothesis. The Egyptian
royal cubit was increased by 1·224 to make the Great
Assyrian cubit. Now this is about the proportion in
which a measure containing a certain weight of water
must be increased in height to contain the same weight
of wheat. This proportion, the water-wheat ratio, is
something between 1·22 and 1·25, the former being
the usual ratio with the heavier wheat of Southern
countries. Supposing a cubical vessel measuring a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>royal cubit of 20·64 inches in each side, therefore
containing 8792 cubic inches = 317 lb. of water (which
was the Great Artaba) to be increased in height so as
to hold the same weight of wheat, its height would now
be 1·224 × 20·64 = 25·26 inches. This might have
been taken for a new cubit.</p>

<p class='c014'>This would not prevent the new cubit, the Great
Assyrian cubit, being itself in course of time cubed to
form the Den measure, as its half, the foot, was cubed
for its weight of water to make the Greek-Asiatic
talent.</p>

<p class='c014'>However this be, the great Assyrian cubit, which
continued to be used in the Persian empire, had the
advantage of being divided into 8 palms and of making
a good two-foot rule, though its half, the foot, was
rather too long for popular use. This cubit exists to
this day in Egypt, being the basis of the Reed or
Qasáb. This is the ‘full reed of six great cubits’
(Ezek. xli.), the ‘measuring rod of six cubits by the
cubit and a handbreadth,’ that is the old seven-palm
cubit with a palm added. The Qasáb = 151·16 inches
is = 12 Assyrian feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet, for the common purposes of life, a foot =
12·63 inches was too long to be popular; everywhere
the people like a short foot, especially in the South and
the East. Moreover the cubit was a departure from
the simple geodesic standard of the meridian cubit.
Accordingly there was devised in Persia a cubit satisfactory
both to the scientific class and to the people,
with a simple geodesic standard for scientific purposes
and a convenient short foot for the common purposes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>of life. This was the Beládi cubit. It is perhaps the
best of the cubits.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>4. <span class='sc'>The Beládi Cubit</span> (<i>c.</i> 300 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>)</h3>

<p class='c020'>The new Persian cubit, known as the Beládi (from
<i>belád</i>, country), had the advantage, first, of a simple
relation to the Parasang or meridian league of 30
stadia = 1/20 degree; secondly, of it being divisible
into two feet of convenient length.</p>

<p class='c014'>The meridian mile being = 6080 feet or 72,960 inches
the parasang is therefore 3 × 72,960 = 218,880 inches;
and the Beládi cubit, 1/10000 of the parasang, was therefore
= 21·880 inches. This is the length that John
Greaves gave in 1645 as his measurement of what he
called the Cairo cubit, one of the different standards
that have accumulated in Egypt during sixty centuries.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Beládi cubit is still to be found in the
East. A half Beládi cubit = 10·944 inches, a convenient
foot for Eastern use, passed to Spain with the
Moors and became the Burgos foot, the standard of which
was allowed to go astray after the fall of the Moorish
dominion. But the Spanish shore-cubit (<i>Covado di
ribera</i>) still exists at the standard of 21·9157 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Beládi cubit is that used by Posidonius (131-53
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>). He gave the circumference of the globe as
240,000 stadia, which = 666·66 to the degree, or
11·111 to the meridian mile of 6080 feet or 72,960 inches,
72,960/11.111 = 6566 inches or 10 fathoms of 65·66465 inches,
exactly 3 Beládi cubits or 6 half-cubits.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is interesting to find this Greek philosopher,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>settled in Rome, reckoning the circumference of the
globe accurately on the basis of the Beládi cubit of
Persia. Coupling this with the use by the Hebrews
of the Bereh equatorial cubit brought back from the
Captivity, the date of the Beládi meridional cubit is
evidently at some centuries before the Christian era.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Bereh or Equatorial Land-mile.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The Jews brought back from the Captivity a
measure known as the Cubit of the Talmud. It was
1/3000 of a mile, called the Bereh, which was said to be
1/24000 the circumference of the earth. Now this
latter fraction corresponds to one-thousandth of an
hour of longitude, or of 15 degrees on the equator, and
thus points to the Bereh being an equatorial, not a
meridian mile. It is still extant in the Turkish
dominions in Asia. While the modern, as the ancient,
Persian Parasang is 1/7200 of the meridian, the Turkish
Farsang of 3 Bereh should be 3/24000 = 1/8000 of the
equatorial circumference—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1/8000 of 2029·11 yards × 60 × 360 = 5478·6 yards.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This corresponds very closely to the length of the
farsang, which is 5483·9 yards. The Bereh, by calculation,
is 1826 yards and the Talmudic cubit, 1/3000 of it,
= 21·914 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>Each then was one 72-millionth of the terrestrial
circumference, but the Talmudic cubit was measured
on the equator, the Beládi cubit on the meridian.</p>

  <h3 class='c019'>5. <span class='sc'>The Black Cubit</span> (<span class='sc'>Ninth Century</span>)</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Many centuries after the institution of the Assyrian
great cubit and of the Persian Beládi cubit, another
important cubit became a standard of measure in the
Moslem caliphate which reigned over the lands of the
Eastern great kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c014'>Under Al-Mamūn, son of Harūn al-Rashid, science
was flourishing in the East, while the West was in the
dark ages, at least in all the countries unenlightened
by the civilisation of the Moors of Spain. Of Christian
Europe, Provence and the other Occitanian countries
alone had that light, a light that shone over other
countries until extinguished by the Albigensian crusade.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Mahmd Ibn Mesoud says that in the time of
Almamon (the learned Calife of Babylon) by the elevation
of the pole of the equator, they measured the
quantity of the degree upon the globe of the earth, and
found it to be 56-2/3 miles, every mile containing
4000 cubits, and each cubit 24 digits, and every digit
6 barleycorns, and every barleycorn 6 hairs of a camel’
(‘A Discourse of the Romane Foot and Denarius,’
by John Greaves, Professor of Astronomy in the
University of Oxford, 1647).</p>

<p class='c014'>From this determination of 56-2/3 meridian miles to the
degree of longitude it would appear, (1) that the measurement
was made at about 20·1°; south of Mecca, (2) that
the meridian mile was still of 4000 Egyptian common
cubits or 1000 Egyptian fathoms.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was then probably after this measurement that
Al-Mamūn instituted his new Cubit, sometimes known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>as the Black cubit, so named from the black banner
and dress adopted by the Abbaside caliphs.</p>

<p class='c014'>This new cubit was not, directly at least, of geodesic
basis. The caliph was probably inspired by the idea
of making in a reasonable manner the alteration which
the ancient Egyptians had done badly in making their
seven-palm cubit out of simple proportion to the
common cubit. So the new cubit had palms and
digits of the same length as the common cubit. But
it had all the inconveniences of the factor seven.
Perhaps Al-Mamūn may have thought that the addition
of a seventh palm was not only a homage to the
seven planets but that it was satisfactory to lengthen
the common cubit in the ratio of the degree of latitude
to that of longitude in a part of his dominions where
the ratio was exactly 7 to 6. This is the ratio at
Alexandria, in 31° N.</p>

<p class='c023'>The Black foot = 14·186 inches, divided into 16

</div>

<p class='c014'>This cubit and foot are still in use. The old nilometer
on the island of Al-Rauzah (Rode) near Cairo
has its scale in cubits of this standard, and measurement
of the worn scale gives 21·29 inches for the cubit.</p>

<p class='c014'>The cubit and foot of Al-Mamūn are the basis of
measures and of weights which spread from Egypt to
every country in Europe.</p>

<p class='c014'>The story of the five cubits, ancient and medieval,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>has shown that they were all derived, directly or indirectly,
from the meridian measurement of the earth,
some of them being probably instituted with the desire
to make them representative of the relation of latitude
and longitude.</p>

<p class='c014'>I venture to say that every measure and weight
used throughout the world has been developed from
one of these cubits and thus, more or less directly, from
the Egyptian meridian cubit. The Republican system
of France is but a decimal imitation of the system
based on the common Egyptian meridian cubit; its
basis being the kilometre, 1/10000 of the quarter-meridian,
instead of the Egyptian meridian mile, 1/(90 × 60) of the
quarter-meridian.</p>

<p class='c014'>There were some other cubits of minor importance;
one of them is the Hashími cubit described in
<a href='#XVII'>Chapter XVII</a>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>It has been seen that throughout the ancient Eastern
Kingdoms, from soon after 5000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> to some centuries
after our era, there was general unity in the system
of linear measures. It will now be seen that there was
similar unity in the system of weights and measures,
all derived from some well-known linear standard
cubed. In modern times this unity is much less
apparent, but yet it can be traced, and it survives with
little change in the great part of the world where the
English system of weights and measures remains as an
inheritance from the most ancient epochs of civilisation.</p>

<p class='c014'>The 400 shekels of silver, currency of the merchants,
that Abraham weighed to Ephron about 1900 years <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
were probably of about the same weight as 400 half-crowns
of the present day.</p>

<p class='c014'>When Moses levied 100 talents and 1775 shekels, at
the rate of half a shekel on each of the 603,550 men
who were numbered (Exod. xxxviii.), the weight of the
silver shekels can be precisely ascertained.</p>

<p class='c014'>603550/2 = 301,775 shekels = 100 talents and 1775 shekels.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Talent was the weight of an Egyptian royal
cubic foot of water and was divided into 3000 shekels.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>The royal foot, 2/3 of the cubit, = 13·76 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The foot cubed = 2605 cubic inches; 2605/27·73 =
93·9 lb. as the calculated weight of the standard afterwards
known as the Alexandrian talent.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The actual weight was 93·65 lb. = 655·550 grains;
655550/3000 = 218·5 grains was the weight of the shekel,
nearly our half-ounce—exactly the half-ounce of
Plantagenet times, and very near to the weight of our
half-crown, which weighs 218·18 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>The difference between calculated weight and the
actual weight determined from coin or other standards,
from trustworthy historical statements and other
sources of information or of evidence, is generally due
to the great difficulty in constructing accurately the
cubical vessel used to ascertain the weight of a cubed
measure of water. A difference of 2/100 of an inch
in the sides of the vessel made to hold a royal cubic
foot of water would make a difference of about 3 parts
in 1000, of 4-1/2 of the 1500 ounces or double-shekels of
water it contained. And we do not know the temperature
of the water used.</p>

<p class='c014'>From the ancient and medieval cubits were derived
all the weights and measures of medieval and modern
civilisation, largely through the medium of the talents
derived from these standards.</p>

  <h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>The Alexandrian Talent</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'>The standard of this talent has been already given
as 93·65 lb., which × 7000 = 655,550 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was divided on different systems:</p>

<p class='c024'>1. By the Chaldæans and Egyptians into 60 minás,
divided—</p>

<p class='c025'>(<i>a</i>) On the Chaldæan system into 60 shekels of
182 grains, with a quarter-shekel = 45-1/2
grains.</p>

<p class='c025'>(<i>b</i>) On the Phœnician, and Hebrew, system into
50 shekels of 218-1/2 grains, with a quarter-shekel
= 54·6 grains.</p>

<p class='c024'>2. By the Greek-Egyptians into 120 minás (or the
half or lesser talent into 60 minás) of 100
drachmæ = 54·6 grains.</p>

<p class='c024'>3. By the Romans into 125 libræ of 12 unciæ
(1500 ounces) further divided by the Greeks
into 8 drachmæ = 54·6 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>Three of these modes of division give a drachma of
54·6 grains. So a Phœnician or Hebrew shekel, a
Ptolemaïc tetradrachm and a Roman half-ounce, are
of the same weight, differing by only 1/4 grain from
our half-ounce, and by only 1/2 grain from our half-crown.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Alexandrian talent was the Hebrew Kikkar or
talent of the sanctuary. In the Chaldæan kingdom the
standard measure was the Egyptian royal cubit, and
the standard weight was the talent derived from its
foot; but the miná appears to have been divided into
60 instead 50 shekels.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The words which Belshazzar saw written on the
wall referred to the miná and shekel, or tekel, of this
talent. Their meaning may be thus rendered:</p>

<p class='c024'>Mene, a miná—the great King Nabupalasur, founder
of the new Chaldæan Kingdom.</p>

<p class='c024'>Mene, a miná—the great King Nabukudurusur, son
of the preceding.</p>

<p class='c024'>Tekel, a shekel (of 4 quarters)—Nabunahid (Belshazzar)
and his three predecessors, all of small
account.</p>

<p class='c024'>Upharsin, a division, perhaps 2 half-shekels, the
Medes and Persians. Or it may simply be the
Parsīs or Persians, the enemies at the gate.</p>

<p class='c014'>This talent is still extant at Bássora (in Chaldæa) as
the <i>mánd sofi</i> = 93·22 lb.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Medimnos.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>This was the measure made to hold an Alexandrian
talent of wheat. The cubed Egyptian royal foot (probably
used as a fluid measure) was increased in the
Southern water-wheat ratio of 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;1·22. Thus 2605 c.i.
× 1·22 = 3176 c.i. and 3176/277·4 = 11·45 gallons as the
contents of the Medimnos.</p>

<p class='c014'>This measure was adopted by the Romans, as
well as by the Greeks, as the basis of their corn-measures,
doubtless in consequence of the corn-trade
from Egypt. A sixth part of it was the Roman Modius.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Medimnos was divided by the Greeks into
48 Choinix, or into 96 Xestes (L. <i>sextarius</i>) = 0·95
Imperial pint or 19 fluid ounces.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>
  <h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>The Lesser Alexandrian or Ptolemaïc Talent</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'>This was half of the ordinary or greater talent.</p>

<p class='c014'>Half the calculated weight of the greater talent
gives 46·956 lb. for the lesser. But the actual weight
was somewhat less, 46·82 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was divided into 60 Ptolemaïc miná = 5462
grains, and the miná into 100 drachms. The drachm
= 54·62 grains and the tetradrachm = 218·5 grains
coincide as coin-weights with the quarter-shekel and
shekel of the greater talent.</p>

<p class='c014'>The miná was divided also on the Roman uncial
system:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1/12 = an ounce = 455·28 grs.;&nbsp;&nbsp;of this</div>
      <div class='line'>1/12 = a double-scruple = 37·94 grs.;&nbsp;&nbsp;of this</div>
      <div class='line'>1/12 = a carat of 3·1616 grs.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The carat 1/144 ounce, is exactly, to 1/100 grain, the
jeweller’s carat of to-day in European countries.</p>

<p class='c014'>What could be the reason for this talent?</p>

<p class='c014'>Its miná was half an Alexandrian miná; its drachm
was a quarter-shekel.</p>

<p class='c014'>Don V. V. Queipo<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a> considered that the half Beládi
cubit had been produced from it by involution, taking
the side of a cubical vessel containing half an Alexandrian
talent of water and then doubling this new foot
to make a new cubit. Its water-volume = 1302·5 c.i.
gives as cube root 10·9207 inches, almost exactly half
the Beládi cubit = 21·888 inches. But the Beládi cubit
being 1/7200 of a Parasang is sufficient evidence of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>origin. I consider that the close coincidence of the
half-cubit with the side of a cubic vessel containing an
Alexandrian half-talent of water led the Ptolemies to
institute this smaller talent, as if it had been evolved
from the Beládi foot in the same way that the Greek-Asiatic
talent had been evolved from the Persian foot
or half-cubit.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>The Greek-Asiatic Talent</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>After the institution of the great Assyrian or
Persian cubit a new talent was necessarily evolved
from it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Persian foot, half of the cubit, was cubed, and
the weight of this cubic foot of water was the Persian
or Greek-Asiatic talent—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>25·26/2 = 12·63 inches; 12·63<sup>3</sup> = 2014 c.i. = 72·61 lb.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The actual weight of this talent (as in the case of
the Alexandrian talent) was somewhat less. It
corresponded to a cubic foot of 2000 c.i., giving
72·13 lb. = 504,910 grains. This was divided into 60
minás—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(72·13 lb. × 1000)/60 = 8415 grams = 1·2 lb.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The miná was divided by the Persians into 100
darics = 84·15 grains. The actual weight of silver
darics found, 83·73 grains, corresponds almost exactly
to this weight.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>This is the talent Herodotus used when estimating
the revenue of the Persian empire. Its miná has
survived as the Attári or Assyrian rotl = 8426 grains,
extant in Algeria. Another Attári pound = 8320
grains is still used at Bássora, near the Persian gulf.
The ounce of this rotl, 8426/16 = 526·6 grains, is exactly
the Russian ounce.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Persian coins weighing 129-130 grains usually
called darics are staters or Greek didrachms.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Metretes</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The second Greek standard of capacity was the
Metretes.</p>

<p class='c014'>While the Medimnos contained an Alexandrian
talent of wheat, the Metretes contained a Greek-Asiatic
talent of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The capacity of the Persian cubic foot was 2000 c.i.
= 72·13 lb. = 7·213 gallons.</p>

<p class='c014'>This cubic foot, increased in water-wheat ratio,
gives 7·213 × 1·22 = 8·8 gallons or 70·4 pints, as the
capacity of the Amphoreus metretes.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Some archæologists have given it as = 8·68 gallons,
a very slight difference.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Metretes was divided into 36 Choinix or 72
Xestes, which contained O·977 pint as against the O·955
pint of the Xestes, which was 1/96 Medimnos. A mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>figure, 0·96 pint, is usually taken as the common
capacity of the two Xestes.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Greeks had thus two standards of capacity,
the Metretes and the Medimnos, both cubic feet
increased in water-wheat ratio to make them corn-measures.
It is very likely that, having these two
measures from different sources, the one of 72
Xestes, the other of 96, they would use the
smaller as a fluid measure. In modern measures
there are several instances of corn-measures having
become wine-measures. Our Imperial gallon used
for fluids is a slightly altered corn-gallon; at
present the multiples above the gallon are used for
corn, the gallon and its divisions for fluids.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>4. <span class='sc'>Roman Weights and Measures of Capacity</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>Used by the Greek colonies in Asia, the Greek-Asiatic
talent passed to the Greek or Trojan colonies
in South Italy, and became the source of the old Roman
pound, the <i>As libralis</i> = 5049 grains, 1/100 of the talent;
(72·13 × 7000)/100 = 5049 grains.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The Aes or As, the bronze or copper pound of the
Roman republic in its earlier times, was divided into
12 ounces, each = 420·75 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>It remained the mint-pound of both Republic and
Empire.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Aurei of Julius Caesar, 1/40 As, weigh 127 grains,
those of Augustus 125 grains. The mean weight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>appears to be about 126 grains, which gives 5040
grains for the As.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Aurei of the later Empire were struck at
1/72 As, and weigh 70 grains, giving the same
weight, 5040 grains, for the As. At 70·1 grains
they would give 5049 grains, the calculated weight
of the As.</p>

<p class='c014'>The evolution of the As from the Greek-Asiatic
talent leads to consideration of the measures connected
with it, and with the Alexandrian talent.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has been seen that the Roman foot, 1/5000 of the
Roman mile, 8 Olympic stadia, was 11·67 inches. This
foot being cubed, the weight of the cubic foot of
water was made the basis of the Roman measures of
capacity—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>11·67<sup>3</sup> inches = 1589 c.i. = 57·32 lb. water</div>
    <div>= 401,240 grains.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This calculated measure, 57·32 lb. = 5·732 gallons
= 45·8 pints, was the Amphora Quadrantal, supposed
to weigh, of wine, 80 As or primitive pounds. <i>Quadrantal
vinei octoginta pondo sit.</i> The correspondence
was only approximate. The Quadrantal should have
been = 57·7 lb. for its 1/80 part (= 5049 grains) to
correspond with the As. Its capacity was probably
adjusted so as to make it half a Medimnos and = 3
Modii.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are specimens extant of the Quadrantal, of
cubical shape, showing that it was named from its
being a cubic foot in measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Quadrantal, being equal to 45·8 pints, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>almost exactly half the Greek Medimnos, equal to
91·5 pints; so that, divided into 8 congii, each of
6 sextarii, the Sextarius, 1/48 Quadrantal, was practically
the same as the Xestes, 1/96 of the Medimnos.</p>

<p class='c014'>And the Quadrantal being also very nearly two-thirds
of the Greek Metretes, equal to 70·4 pints, the
Sextarius was also nearly the same as the other Xestes,
1/72 of the Metretes.</p>

<p class='c014'>So the Sextarius was 1/48 Quadrantal, 1/72 Metretes,
and 1/96 Medimnos.</p>

<p class='c014'>The relation of the Roman Modius to the Alexandrian-Greek
medimnos appears to be only a coincidence,
as the former is one-third of a Roman cubic foot, and
the latter an Alexandrian cubic foot increased in water-wheat
ratio.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The New Roman Pound</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>Trade with Egypt led the Romans, not only to use
the Alexandrian medimnos, but also to put aside the
As for commercial purposes and adopt a standard
taken from the Alexandrian talent. Its 1500 double-shekels
made 125 libræ each of 12 unciæ = 437 grains.
The libra was thus = 5244 grains as compared with
the As = 5049 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>A further uncial division of the libra made the Uncia
either of 6 sextulæ, 24 scrupuli, 48 oboli, 144 siliquæ, or
of 12 semi-sextulæ, 144 siliquæ.</p>

<p class='c014'>The siliqua was a little less than the Eastern qirát,
being 3·03 grains instead of the 3·1616 grain carat of
the Ptolemaïc series of weights.</p>

</div>

<p class='c020'>From the Olympic foot, two-thirds of that most
ancient linear standard the common cubit of Egypt and
the other Eastern monarchies, a talent was also constructed—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>12·16<sup>3</sup> in. = 1798 c.i. = 64·81 lb. water = 453,670 grs.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>and in practice its actual weight was the same as
that calculated.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was divided in two ways:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. On the Bosphoric system, which prevailed in
Asia Minor, in the Phœnician colonies, and in some
parts of Greece, it was divided into 80 miná, each =
5670 grains, and these into 100 drachms of 56·7 grains.
Or the Bosphoric miná was divided uncially into
12 ounces of 472·5 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. On the Euboic system, frequently used in Greek
commerce, this talent was divided into 50 minás of
100 drachms.</p>

<p class='c014'>The drachm = 90·73 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was also a Euboic talent which coincided
with the weight of the Roman Quadrantal, nominally
of 80 As weight = 57·7 lb., and in transactions with
the East the Romans appear to have called their
Quadrantal-weight of water a Euboic talent. But it
will presently be seen that this was the Attic monetary
talent.</p>

<p class='c014'>The volume of an Olympic talent of water was
8 times the Hebrew Bath or, for dry goods,
Epha.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>6. <span class='sc'>Greek Coin-weights</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>In ancient Greece as in medieval Europe, financial
difficulties led rulers to lower the weight of the coinage.
But while in Europe, in England for instance, more
pennies were coined from the mint-pound of silver,
this remaining fixed, although nominally based on the
weight of the sterling, the weights of Greece were
actually based on that of the drachma.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the drachma was diminished in weight, the
miná and the talent both dropped proportionately.
Thus the standard of the Alexandrian talent, carefully
preserved in Egypt, dropped in Greece.</p>

standard of 9308 grains = 1·33 lb. and the talent at

57·7 lb., came to coincide with the Attic monetary
talent.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>7. <span class='sc'>The Arabic Talent</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>To the talents and measures of capacity evolved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>from the feet of the three principal cubits of antiquity,
must be added the talent and other measures evolved
from the Black foot of Al-Mamūn’s cubit. They have
had great influence on the weights and measures of
Europe.</p>

<p class='c014'>Al-Mamūn’s cubit was = 21·28 inches, the foot =
14·186 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The foot cubed gave a measure of water, the weight
of which was the Egyptian Cantar or Cental—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This talent was divided in two ways:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. As the Romans had divided the Alexandrian
talent into 125 pounds of 12 ounces, so the new talent
was divided into 125 parts each = 5763 grains. This
was the Arabic lesser Rotl, its ounce = 480·25 grains.
The rotl was also divided in the Greek way into
100 drachms or dirhems = 57·63 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. Another mode of division was into 100 greater
Rotl, thus becoming a Cental of 100 lb. each =
7204·4 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>This greater rotl was divided, commercially into
16 ounces (Ar. <i>ukyé</i>, Gr. <i>oggia</i>, L. <i>uncia</i>) of 450,275
grains, and uncially for coin-weight into 12 × 12
dirhems of 50·03 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>Both these dirhems became, like the drachma coin-weights
of Greece, the bases of other systems of
weight, either at their original weight or at the lower
weights to which coins might fall.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Lesser Rotl—</p>

<p class='c014'>1. With its ounce of 480-1/4 grains would seem to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>have given rise to the Troy pounds, but it is much
more probable that their variable ounces were
10 dirhems of about 48 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. From 8 of its drachms came the Venetian pound
and the German apothecaries’ pound with an ounce of
8 × 57·63 = 461 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>From the Greater Rotl came—</p>

<p class='c014'>1. Eight of its ounces of 450-1/4 grains = the Marc
of Cologne, its double being the German Imperial
pound = 7218 grains; our royal Tower-pound of
Plantagenet times being 12 ounces = 5400 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>The 100 lb. centner of North Germany = 103·1 lb.
was almost exactly the same weight as Al-Mamūn’s
Cantar.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE INVOLUTION OF LINEAR MEASURES FROM<br />WEIGHTS</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c019'><span class='sc'>The Sources of the English and of the Rhineland<br />Foot</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>Commerce is the great conservator of standards. These
may become altered by the ill-advised action of rulers,
by municipal or parochial carelessness, even by the
desire of profit on short measure, or occasionally, as
seen to a slight extent in our old Bushel, by the faulty
dimensions of a standard; but wholesale trade,
supported, in weights at least, by the goldsmith and
the apothecary, preserved the integrity of many
standards during the Middle Ages and up to modern
times. Commerce conveyed to the West the standards
that had developed in the great Oriental Kingdoms,
sometimes with the modifications due to Roman
influence. Masons and architects also preserved the
standards of length and, allowing for variations
inevitable under the feudal system, the principal linear
measures can generally be traced to their sources as
surely as weights. But there are two, yea three,
striking exceptions among the linear standards of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>West: the English foot, and the Rhineland foot,
and also the Pán of Marseilles. These are quite
unconnected with any ancient measures, and there is no
record of their origin. The only clue to it is found
in the simple relation of each to the corresponding
weights and measures of capacity, the origin of which
can be satisfactorily traced. This leads to the hypothesis
that these linear measures were ‘involved,’ that
is produced by a method of involution the inverse
of that which had evolved the measures of weight and
capacity.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>The English Foot</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>There seem three hypotheses for the origin of the
English foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>1. That it was the Olympic foot = 12·16 inches, its
standard diminished by the accidents of time.</p>

<p class='c014'>But we know that the Romans established their
measures in Britain, and our mile of 8 stadia and of
5000 feet (first Roman, then English) up to Tudor times,
shows that it was originally 1000 Roman paces of
5 feet; and our early wine-bushel, of which the wine-gallon
was 1/8, is referable to the cube of the English
foot, not to that of the Olympic foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is no trace of the Olympic foot in Northern
Europe except the possibility (mentioned under
Foreign Linear Measures) of the Amsterdam local foot,
= 11·146 inches, being 11 inches of the Olympic foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. It happens that the mean of the Roman foot =
11·67 inches, and of the Rhineland foot = 12·356
inches, gives 12·013 inches. But there is no instance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>of a new standard being formed from the mean of two
older ones; moreover this hypothesis begs the question
of the Rhineland foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The hypothesis which I consider the most likely
is that the foot is the measure of the side of a cubical
vessel containing 1000 Roman ounces of water. It
seems likely that in early times, possibly under King
Alfred by the advice of Italian moneyers or Jewish
merchants, this measurement was effected in order to
establish a foot and a cubic foot measure of capacity
corresponding to a new talent of 1000 Roman ounces.
There is no record of this, any more than there is a
record of the standard taken for the Tower pound of
the Norman and Plantagenet kings. All we know is
that, during the times of these kings, the relation of
Averdepois or Roman weight to our measures of
capacity was utterly ignored until at last, in 1685,
‘some Gentlemen at Oxford determined the weight
of a cubic foot of spring water, or 1728 solid inches, to
be 1000 ounces averdepois.’ That the correct weight is
not 1000 but about 998 ounces at 62° does not militate
against the connexion of the weight and measure
any more than the fact that a cubic decimetre of
water, supposed to weigh 1000 grammes, only weighs
about 998-1/2 grammes would disprove a connexion
between the cubic decimetre and the gramme.</p>

<p class='c014'>The difficulty of making a ‘quadrantal,’<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a> a vessel
of exactly cubical form inside, is so great that the
wardens of the Metric System abandoned the cubic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>decimetre of water as giving the standard, either of
the litre for capacity, or of the kilogramme for weight.
Even approximate accuracy was unattainable, and
they were obliged to make the kilogramme an arbitrary
standard of mass and the litre a vessel containing a
kilogramme of water.</p>

<p class='c014'>When it is seen that a difference of 1 in 2500 in
the length of the foot taken as the inside measure of a
quadrantal makes a difference of 3 cubic inches out of
1728 in its capacity, the material difficulties of constructing
a vessel exactly cubical will be understood.
However, a quadrantal being constructed, perhaps after
many trials of sides as exactly equal as possible, and
holding 1000 ounces of Roman ounces (= 437 grains) of
water, the mean measure of its panels was taken as a foot,
and the quadrantal as a cubic foot—the wine-bushel.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us take 1000 Roman ounces and divide the
total number of grains weight by the statute number
of grains in a cubic inch of water as determined by
Captain Kater in 1824.</p>

<p class='c014'>The dividend will be the number of cubic inches,
and its cube root will be the foot—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>437,000/252,458 = 1729·8 cubic inches,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>of which the cube root is 12·0042 inches, a length
differing by only 1/2400 from the actual Imperial foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>I took the idea of this hypothesis from that by
which Don V. V. Queipo inferred the Beládi cubit to
be the double measure of the side of a cubical vessel
containing a Ptolemaïc talent of water. Certainly it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>solves the question of the origin of our foot, and it
happens that, applied to the equally obscure origin of
the Rhineland foot, the results are equally satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us apply to 1000 ounces of water, at the medium
Amsterdam standard, = 10 Egyptian dirhems of 47·6
grains, the same measurement of a quadrantal made to
contain them as exactly as possible.</p>

<p class='c014'>and the cube root of the dividend gives 12·357 inches,
exactly, to 1 in 20,000, the Rhineland foot as established
in Prussia = 12·3564 inches. The Prussian standard
of the Cologne pound (its ounce = 451·1 grains) was
1/66 of a Rhineland cubic foot of water at 65·75 F., and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>was fixed at 7217·9 grains. This was exactly 1/66 of
1000 Troy ounces of water at the standard of 476·38
grains. So 66 Prussian pounds were equal to 1000
Troy ounces, or to 62·5 Troy pounds at that standard.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Rhineland cubic foot had, like the English
cubic foot, long been the bushel standard of North
Germany. The Himt, now, or until quite recently,
the unit of corn-measure in Hanover and Brunswick,
contained 6·852 gallons, or 68·52 lb. of water. It is
probable that the Himt, which passed to Scotland
in the fifteenth century as the firlot of that time, had
risen slightly, and that it was originally = 68·05 lb., the
true Rhineland cubic foot of water.</p>

<h3 id='Pan' class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>The Pán of Marseilles</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>Marseilles, a city of Greek origin, always in extensive
commercial relations with the Mediterranean countries
using the Arabic system of weights and measures, had
an almost perfect system of its own, entirely sexdecimal,
and dating from about the tenth century.
This system is still extant, so far as the French law
can be evaded (see <a href='#XXI'>Chap. XXI</a>: Old Weights and
Measures of France). Wine and corn measures were
in the usual Southern water-wheat ratio of 1 to 1·22,
and the principal of these was the Escandau for wine
and oil, and the Panau for corn. Now Escandau
means ‘standard’; and this measure was 1/4 of the
Mieirolo, the half wine-load or ‘wey’ which corresponded
in water-wheat ratio to the half-load or wey of
wheat. The load of wheat, the <i>cargo</i>, was the cubic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>cubit of Al-Mamūn, brought from Egypt by the corn-trade.
The unit of length was the Pan (pronounced
páng), a word apparently similar to the palmo of Italy
and Spain, but really different. Palmo becomes
<i>paume</i> in Provençal, while Pan is from L. <i>pannus</i>, a
side, pane or panel;<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a> and the Marseilles Pan = 9·9
inches is exactly the measure of the side or pan of an
Escandau of cubical form. The filiation of the
Escandau is evident, while the Pan is not derived from
any antecedent measure. That the Pan was the
measure of the pan or panel of a cubical Escandau is
supported by the name of the corn-standard, the
Panau, corresponding to the fluid standard of the
Escandau, and of the land-measure, L. <i>Panalata</i>, the
peck-land, originally the extent usually sown with a
Panau of wheat.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Escandau = 16·096 litres = 3·54 gallons.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>∛16096 = 25·24 centimetres, the Pan = 9·9 inches.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The evidence of the Pan seems to me to remove any
doubt as to the medieval evolution of linear measures
from imported standards of weight or capacity.
The meaning of Pan as ‘side, panel’ is conclusive,
especially when supported by the Panau measure
and by other Provençal derivatives:</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Panard</i>, a limping man, leaning to one side as he
walks.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Lou Panard</i>, the star Antares which, rising late
and setting early, not appearing much above the
horizon, is visible only on one side of it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c020'>In the description of the ancient cubits and talents
and of the Roman system derived from them, the
filiation of the English system of weights and measures,
and of the Scots and other cognate systems, is clearly
seen. There was no taking of a King’s heel-to-toe as a
foot, no pound imported from some unknown country
at an unknown period, no wheat-quarter preserved in
the dimensions of an Egyptian sarcophagus, not even
a pint from the Roman sextarius; legend disappears,
the course of evolution, and, at one point, of involution,
is clear, and as thoroughly scientific as in any system
invented by an Academy of Sciences. Here are the
links of filiation of the English foot:</p>

<p class='c015'>1. The Egyptian meridian cubit.</p>

<p class='c015'>2. The royal cubit, increased from the meridian
cubit.</p>

<p class='c015'>3. The royal foot, two-thirds of the royal cubit.</p>

<p class='c015'>4. The cubic royal foot.</p>

<p class='c015'>5. The Alexandrian talent, the weight of a royal
cubic foot of water.</p>

<p class='c015'>6. The Roman ounce, 1/1500 of the Alexandrian
talent.</p>

<p class='c015'>7. The English talent, 1000 Roman ounces.</p>

<p class='c015'>8. The volume of 1000 Roman ounces of water, the
original wine-bushel.</p>

<p class='c015'>9. The 1000-ounce Quadrantal becomes the cubic
foot, its side giving the English foot.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>For the Rhineland and Scots system we have:</p>

<p class='c015'>1. The Egyptian meridian cubit.</p>

<p class='c015'>2. The Arabic or Black cubit, 7 palms of the
meridian cubit’s 6 palms.</p>

<p class='c015'>3. The Arabic foot, two-thirds of the Arabic cubit.</p>

<p class='c015'>4. The Arabic talent or Cantar, the weight of an
Arabic cubic foot of water.</p>

<p class='c015'>5. The Troy ounce, 1/1500 of the Cantar, and coinciding
with 10 lesser dirhems of about 48 grains.</p>

<p class='c015'>6. The Rhineland talent of 1000 Troy ounces
Amsterdam standard.</p>

<p class='c015'>7. The Quadrantal containing 1000 Troy ounces of
water becomes the cubic Rhineland foot, its side giving
the measure of the Rhineland foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>For the Provençal system we have:</p>

<p class='c015'>1. The Egyptian meridian cubit.</p>

<p class='c015'>2. The Arabic cubit, 7 palms of the meridian
cubit’s 6 palms.</p>

<p class='c015'>3. The Arabic cubit cubed, in the corn-measure of
medieval Egypt, the Cargo of Marseilles, the Setier of
Paris.</p>

<p class='c015'>4. The half-cargo reduced to wine-measure in
wheat-water ratio becomes the Mieirolo; of which one-fourth
is the Escandau or Standard measure.</p>

<p class='c015'>5. The Quadrantal containing an Escandau gives,
as the measure of its side or panel, the Pán of Marseilles.</p>

<p class='c014'>The evolution of the English foot, of the Rhineland
or Scots foot, of the Pán of Marseilles, being now made
clear, we can proceed to English and other linear
measures. The origin of the Ounce, the foot, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>cubic foot or wine-bushel is explained. That of Troy
weight has been seen, and its predecessor, Tower
weight, came from another ounce of the Arabic cantar.
The origin of every measure and weight used in the
civilised world will be found in the stories of the
ancient cubits and talents.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br /><span class='small'>ENGLISH LINEAR MEASURES</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>The Yard, the Foot, the Inch</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The term Yard, the Old English ‘gerde’ or ‘yerde,’ a
wand or rod, became specially applied to a wand of
3 feet, or 4 spans; from this double mode of division
and from its convenient length the cloth-yard of 3 feet
became generally used. It has the convenience of
being a half-fathom, and of being divisible not only
into feet and inches, but also sexdecimally into units
which are familiar as limb-lengths of the cubit and
span system.</p>

<p class='c014'>The half-yard corresponds to the Cubit.</p>

<p class='c014'>The quarter-yard is a Span.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The eighth is a Finger; women constantly measure
linen approximately by the length of the bent middle
finger.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sixteenth is a Nail; this is the length of the
half-finger, the last two joints of the middle finger.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>While the yard is lawfully divided into halves,
quarters, eighths, and nails, it may also, as a measure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>of 3 feet, be divided into 36 inches. Yard-measures
are usually divided in both ways, on one side into
16 nails, on the other into inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is customary to say either a yard and a quarter,
or 45 inches, or 3 feet 9 inches. Or to say either
58 inches or 4 feet 10 inches; but it is not customary
to say a yard and 22 inches. We cease to use the yard
as unit when we cannot express its fractions sexdecimally.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Foot is lawfully divided into 12 inches; but
there is nothing to prevent it being divided decimally,
or otherwise, as convenient.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Inch is divided according to convenience, either</p>

<p class='c024'>Sexdecimally, into halves, quarters, &amp;c., down
to sixty-fourths. This is the usual division.</p>

<p class='c024'>Duodecimally, into 12 lines.</p>

<p class='c024'>Decimally, into tenths and hundredths.</p>

<p class='c014'>Steel foot-rules usually show all three of these
scales.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some trades may have special scales. Thus type-founders
divide the Inch into 6 ‘picas’ each = 2 lines,
and the ‘pica’ into 12 points each = 1/6 line or 1/72 inch.
Nonpareil type is 6 points; Brevier is 8 points.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>Standards of the Linear Measures</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>Tables of measures, from the earliest, about 1500,
down to quite recent times, usually began by stating
that ‘Three barley-corns make an inch’ or that
‘Geographical measures begin at a barley-corn and
increase upward to a league,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>King David I of Scotland (<i>c.</i> 1150) is credited with
the pronouncement that the Scots inch was to be the
mean measure of ‘the thowmys of iij men, that is to
say an mekill man and a man of messurabil statur and
of a lytell man. The thoums are to be messurit at the
rut of the nayll.’ But no more in Scotland than in
England, or elsewhere, has the inch ever been anything
but a division of the foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>A standard of the English foot was fixed in Old St.
Paul’s Church, London, and was known as Paul’s foot,
all measures being referred to the standard ‘qui
insculpitur super basim columpnæ in ecclesia Sancti
Pauli.’ In 1273 a deed gave the measurement of
land ‘according to the iron ell [yard] of the King’s
palace.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The present standard yard is a bronze bar kept
in London, the length of which agrees exactly with the
yard, still extant, of Tudor times. A set of standard
measures of length is fixed along the base of the northern
wall of Trafalgar Square,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and another set is in the
flooring of the Guildhall. Sets are also fixed to public
buildings in several chief towns of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p class='c014'>As metal rods vary in length according to temperature,
comparisons with a standard measure should be
made at the normal temperature of 62°. But there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>an alloy of steel and nickel (42 per cent.), named Invar,
which is not perceptibly affected by temperature.</p>

<p class='c014'>A pendulum beating seconds at sea-level and at
normal temperature measures 39·1393 inches at
Greenwich (Act of Parliament, 1824). This length
varies in different places from the variations of gravity
due to the ellipticity of the earth and local causes of
deviation.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>The Hand</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The popular ‘hand’ was the ‘palm’ of ancient
times, four digits or finger-breadths.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Pes habet palmos iv, palmus habet digitos iv</i>
(Frontinus).</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Foure graines of barlye make a finger; foure
fingers a hande; foure handes a foote’ (Eden, 1566).</p>

<p class='c014'>But the present Hand for horse-measurement is
‘the measure called a Handful used in measuring the
height of horses, by 27 Hen. 8, Chap. 6, ordained to
be 4 inches’ (Sam. Leake, 1701). This is part of an
old popular duodecimal division of the foot into 3 hands
of 4 inches, then of the inch into 3 barleycorns (lengthwise)
each of 4 poppy-seeds, and of these again into
12 hairbreadths.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Austria this horse-measure is the Faust or fist.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another very widely spread limb-measure is that
of the fist with the thumb projecting, roughly =
6 inches. It is the Shaftment of some parts of England,
<i>scæft-mund</i> (shaft-hand) in Old English, <i>bawd</i> in Wales;
the <i>somesso</i> of Italy, the <i>kubdeh</i> of Egypt, the <i>taim</i> of
Burma.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>In the Laws of Æthelstan (1000) a measurement is
given as 9 feet, 9 shaftments, and 9 barleycorns, i.e.
9 feet + 9 half-feet + 3 inches.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>4. <span class='sc'>The Ell</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The yard, being 4 spans, was formerly one of the
Ells, measures of 3, 4, 5 or more spans, related to the
cubit of 2 spans. The Scots yard, of 37 inches, was
always known as an Ell, and it was only gradually that
our yard took the place, for cloth measure, of the Ell
of 5 spans = 45 inches, which was long maintained by
statute. The yard and the ell were usually distinguished
as <i>virga</i> and <i>ulna</i> in statutes, but sometimes
<i>ulna</i> meant a yard.</p>

<p class='c014'>Both yard and ell were divided into halves, quarters,
and nails (sixteenths).</p>

<p class='c014'>See <a href='#XVI'>Chap. XVI</a> (The Ells), and <a href='#XX'>Chap. XX</a> (section
on the Nail and the Clove).</p>

<h3 class='c019'>5. <span class='sc'>The Rod, Furlong, Mile, and League</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The earliest table of English linear measures is
probably that in Arnold’s ‘Customs of London,’
<i>c.</i> 1500.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The lengith of a barly corne iij tymes make an ynche</div>

      <div class='line in4'>cxxv pace make a furlong</div>
      <div class='line'>and viij furlong make an English myle.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Thus, in 1500, the furlong was 125 × 5 = 625 feet,
and the mile = 5000 feet = 1666·6 yards.</p>

<p class='c014'>The mile was originally the Roman mile,
1000 paces or 5000 Roman feet, and = (5000 × 11·67)/(3 × 12)
in. = 1621-1/3 yards. So in course of time our mile
had become 5000 English feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the linear unit for land measurement was not,
as in the Roman system, a <i>pertica</i> or rod of 10 or 12 feet;
it became very early, on the Teutonic system, a rod
of 16 feet, with varieties, under French influence later
on, of 18, of 21 and 24 feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>In early Plantagenet times, not later than Edward I,
the statute rod was fixed at 5-1/2 yards or 16-1/2 feet.
Thus, while the rood, that is the field-furlong, was
40 rods or perches of 16-1/2 feet = 660 feet, the itinerary
furlong, 1/8 mile, remained 625 feet, ‘xxxviij perchis
sauf ij fote’ (Arnold’s ‘Chronicle’). This clashing of the
new statute rod, and its multiple the rood or field-furlong
of 40 rods, with the ancient itinerary furlong
now only = 37·87 rods, was rectified in Tudor times,
probably temp. Henry VII, but definitely by a
statute of Elizabeth which raised the furlong to
coincide with the rood. The mile thus became of its
present length, 8 furlongs of 40 rods of 5-1/2 yards =
1760 yards = 5280 feet. The mile has then successively
been:</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>LAND-MEASURES</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>Introduction</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The first measures of land were seed-measures. They
are found in every country; they become fixed in
course of time as the idea of geometric measurement
arises; they survive in name giving the peasant a
concrete idea of the extent of his fields.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then came the estimation of land by the amount of
ploughing, or sometimes of hand-digging, that could
be done in a day, and by the extent that could be
cultivated with a pair of oxen. Then came a system
of geometric measurement, fixing the former seed-units
or labour-units by measures of length and breadth, and
finally the abstract idea of superficial area. These
different systems have succeeded one another everywhere
and in all time.</p>

<p class='c014'>1. Seed-units.—The land that could be sown with
a certain measure of seed-corn, wheat being the usual
standard: Fr. <i>seterée</i>, <i>estrée</i>, <i>boisselée</i>, &amp;c.; It. <i>moggio</i>;
Sp. <i>fanega</i>; G. <i>scheffel</i>; Nor. <i>tunn-land</i>. These
names correspond to corn-measures.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>2. Day’s hand-labour units.—The land that could
be tilled with spade or hoe in a day: the ‘Daieswork,’
about 10 square rods; Fr. <i>hommée</i>, <i>ouvrée</i>—20 square
rods of vineyard.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. Day’s ploughing units.—L. <i>jugerum</i>; It. <i>giornata</i>;
Fr. <i>journal</i>, <i>arpent</i>; G. <i>morgen</i>, <i>joch</i>, <i>acker</i>; Du.
<i>bouw</i>; Hind. <i>bigha</i>; Ar. <i>feddan</i>; Ir. <i>ardagh</i>. All about
an English acre more or less.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. Oxgang units.—The land that a boor with a
yoke of oxen could keep in husbandry; about 7 acres
of arable, about 30 acres including wood and pasture:</p>

<p class='c014'>Yard-land; Du. <i>hoeve</i>. A group of oxgangs,
generally of four yoke, made a Ploughland; Prov. <i>un
mas de quatre couble</i>, a four-yoke farm.</p>

<p class='c014'>5. Geometric units.—First, units of a certain shape
based on the customary length of the furrow: Rood,
40 rods by 1 rod broad; Fr. <i>vergée</i>, <i>seillon</i>. Then
small units of a square rod, the rod being of customary
length; with large units, usually groups of roods,
vergées, &amp;c. Four roods side by side make the English
or the Norman acre. A rood square or square furlong
is the ‘acreme’ or 10-acre field.</p>

<p class='c014'>Legal units of land were usually abstract, of so
many square rods or fathoms, independently of any
customary shape.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>Evolution of Geometric Land-measures</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>While smaller units, such as the superficial rod,
can easily be conceived as square, the larger arable
units have, or have had, a peculiar form which still
attaches to them. The peasant, whose mind’s eye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>can perceive the square rod or toise or verge, refers the
rood or the acre, the vergée or the arpent, to the
familiar length of the furrow and to the breadth of the
rod or of the four-rod acre-breadth equal to a cricket-pitch.
These lengths and breadths will long be his
essentially concrete standards of field-measurement.</p>

<p class='c014'>While some legal units of surface have recognised
the customary furrow-length as an element of this
form, others have always been undefined as to
form.</p>

<p class='c014'>In ancient Egypt the land was surveyed by the
state, not only for revenue purposes, but because of
the Nile overflow effacing the land-marks usual in
other countries.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Hence land-measuring appears to me to have had
its beginning, and to have passed over to Greece’
(Herodotus). The agrarian unit of Egypt, called by
the Greeks <i>aroura</i>, a plough-land, was a square, each
side being a Khet or cord, of 100 royal cubits = 172
feet or 57-1/3 yards. The square khet is represented by
the present Egyptian feddan al risach of 20 lesser
qasáb (each 20 × 4 Hashími cubits) = 170·4 feet
square = 2/3 acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ten square khet made the usual land-holding.
This unit, = 6·79 acres, corresponds closely to 10 modern
feddan, to the véli or oxgang unit of Southern India,
and to the 7 acres of arable in the medieval English
boor’s yard-land. That the ancient Egyptian oxgang
was 10 khets in a line, giving if required a furrow of
573 yards easy in muddy alluvial soil, seems certain,
for its hieroglyphic is a line of ten small squares.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>This is exactly the primitive form of the English
acre, 10 × 1 chains.</p>

<p class='c014'>In ancient Greece the unit of land-measure was the
plethron of 10 rods (kalamoi) each of 10 Olympic feet,
= 101·33 English feet. Had it a concrete agrarian
form? Evidently the square plethron (= 0·235 acre
or nearly a rood) was much too short for a plough-unit;
but the larger unit was the tetragyon, i.e. a four-rood
field, and with the four square plethra end-on-end,
this Greek acre afforded a furrow-length of 135
yards. So it is probable that the tetragyon, 135 ×
33-3/4 yards, = 0·94 acre, was the usual concrete agrarian
unit.</p>

<p class='c014'>A common size of land-holding was 12 × 12 = 144
plethra, = about 34 acres, a size corresponding to our
medieval oxgang.</p>

<p class='c014'>In ancient Italy land was measured by the Roman
decempeda or pertica, the 10-foot perch or rod,
= 9·725 feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>A strip of land 120 × 4 Roman feet made an Actus,
probably the breadth of a double furrow, up and down.
The square actus, actus quadratus, = 30 acti =
120 × 120 feet, about 50 square rods.</p>

<p class='c014'>Two square acti made a Jugerum, the day’s work
for a yoke of oxen, = 0·623 acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>Four square acti, bina jugera, made the Heredium,
= 1·246 acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>How were the four square acti arranged? Were
they in a square 240 × 240 feet? No doubt that
would be the official form of the heredium; but it is
probable that, as I have assumed for the Greek tetragyon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>of 4 square plethra, the 4 Roman acti would be,
when convenient, practically arranged in a line, thus
giving an agrarian unit of 480 × 120 feet and a furrow
of about 160 yards, which is nearly one-tenth of the
5000 feet Roman mile.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c016'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The official division of the field was based on the
jugerum; this being divided, on the duodecimal or
uncial system, into 12 unciæ, each of 24 square perticæ,
the latter being the scruples, the qiráts, of the Roman
land-ounce. Here we see the uncial system overshadowing
the decempeda; for if the jugerum could be
divided into 12 ounces of 240 × 10 feet and these into
24 scruples of 10 feet square, each of its two acti might
also be divided into 100 sections of 12 feet square, or the
double jugerum into 100 sections of 24 feet square. It
is probable that this would be a more popular division
than that based on the decempeda; for it is certain
that a rod of 16 spans = 12 feet was used; it was the
Græco-Roman <i>akena</i> (from <i>akis</i>, goad), a gad or rod.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Heredium passed to Gaul, where it established
itself in the north, becoming the French arpent, 100
square perches, each of 6 aunes (= 24 Roman feet)
square, so that the arpent is identical with the heredium,
and was divided on the plan I have suggested as that
of the Roman land-measure. But the arpent rarely
coincided with the standard of the Paris government,
and both seed-measures and work-measures, of fixed
area, were often preferred. Where the <i>coutumes de
Normandie</i> are still in almost full force and are cherished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>by the people, the principal unit of land-measure
was, and is still, the Acre de Normandie, containing
160 perches of 24 feet square. The standard of the
foot varies; sometimes it is the royal foot, sometimes
the Roman foot, retained by the device of taking 11
royal inches for a foot. The ancient standard of this
acre is thus expressed in law-Latin: Pertica terræ
fecit 24 passus seu soleas pedis; 40 perticæ faciunt
virgatam; duæ virgatæ faciunt arpentum; 4 virgatæ
faciunt acram. ‘Passus’ is here a foot; but sometimes
it meant a pace, half of the Roman pace which is
here represented by the brasse of 5 royal feet = 1·624
metre. So in Normandy land-measure the <i>pas</i> =
32 inches and the Caux peasant reckons his vergée as
100 × 20 paces = 88·8 × 17·76 yards. These concrete
forms of land-unit are dying out, yet everywhere traces
of it can be found in conversation with old peasants.</p>

<p class='c014'>From the South of France to England and Scotland
there is a concrete shape recognisable in the large unit
of land-measure. The Provençal Saumado of 1600
square cano or toises, the Normandy acre of 160 square
rods of 4 toises, the English acre of 160 square rods of
5-1/2 yards, the Scots acre of 160 square rods of 6 ells
= 18·53 feet, are all connected by a common tradition
of concrete form, and are all made up of four minor
units: sesteirado, vergées, roods, &amp;c. Looking back
to the land-measures of Greece and Rome we
find this same group of four lesser units in the
tetragyon and heredium. The law may only recognise
abstract superficial standards, but the peasant holds
to the concrete units of form convenient for cultivation.</p>

  <h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>English Land-measures</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Notwithstanding Homer’s recommendation of mules
as ‘better far than kine to drag the jointed plough,’
oxen are still used in the greater part of the world. In
light soils one yoke of oxen is sufficient, but in heavy
fallows, with deep-working ploughs, two, three or
more yoke were used; and in feudal times it would
appear that the four tenants of a hide or ploughland
co-operated with their oxen. A furrow of 40 rods could
thus be made easily in one breath, and as this length
of a rood coincided approximately with the eighth of a
mile, that division of the mile was also called a furrow-long
or furlong. When ploughing up fallow-land the
oxen, on getting to the end of the ‘shot,’ turned
and took breath. The ploughman measured a rod-breadth
from the first furrow by means of his goad,
Scottice by the ‘fall’ of it, and this rod-breadth down
which the oxen turned, the <i>tornatura</i> of Italy, was a rood.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sometimes between the roods a narrow unploughed
strip, a balk of land, was left, marking the roods or
‘selions,’ four of which, side by side, made an acre,
and forty of which made the square furlong, the ten-acre
field.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ploughing in roods, selions, square furlongs, is still
far from extinct. In Brittany land is still reckoned
by <i>seillons</i> of so many furrows wide, or of so many
<i>gaules</i> or 12-foot rods. In Southern France fields are
estimated in breadths of a <i>destre</i>, of the 12-foot rod
corresponding roughly to the width cleared by a couple
of mowers. In our Isle of Axholme, in North Lincolnshire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>land is reckoned in selions of a rod wide and usually
of a furlong in length; these selions or roods being
grouped into furlongs, that is, actually or originally, into
greater units of a square furlong = 40 roods or 10 acres.</p>

<p class='c014'>Simple country-folk, whose only ideas of land-measure
were taken from the length of the ox-goad
and of the furrow, and from the breadth of the long
acre-strip of land, came slowly to understand that the
surface of a field of irregular shape might be reckoned
in acres and rods. A statute of Edward II gave a
table of the different breadths of the acre when it was
less than forty rods or perches in length:</p>

<p class='c014'>‘When an acre of land containeth ten perches in
length, then it shall be in breadth sixteen perches;
when it containeth eleven perches in length, then it
shall be in breadth fourteen and a half and three-quarters
of a foot’—and so on through the different
lengths an acre might be.</p>

<p class='c014'>So people came gradually to abstract the idea of
superficial measure from shape and to apply it to land
of any figure, however different from a square or a
rectangle. Thus measures, always <i>concrete</i> at first
and taken from some known object of comparison,
became <i>abstract</i> in men’s minds for purposes of calculation.
Then came the land-surveyor introducing
arithmetic and geometry into the art of measurement,
and using the cord or chain instead of the measuring
rod; and it was also found that decimal calculation
would be an improvement in this art.</p>

<p class='c014'>For purposes of accurate measurement and calculation,
Edward Gunter introduced, nearly three centuries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>ago, measurement by a chain of a hundred links and
twenty-two yards or four rods in length. Its adoption
decimalised the land-measures without disturbing
them. Ten chains go to a furlong and ten square
chains to an acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>Norden (‘Surveior’s Dialogue,’ 1610) mentions the
‘standard chaine, that is by the chaine of 16-1/2 foote.’
It was soon after this that the chain was increased to
66 feet or 4 rods, which length was a current unit, the
‘brede’ or acre-brede, the breadth of an acre.</p>

plough-lands and rental of England. Estates are thus

<h3 class='c019'>5. <span class='sc'>Terms used in Land-measures</span></h3>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Rod.</span>—Pole, Perch, Goad, Lug, L. <i>pertica</i>, Fr.
<i>perche</i>, <i>verge</i>, G. <i>ruthe</i>, Du. <i>roede</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>The equivalent words, L. <i>virga</i>, Fr. <i>verge</i>, A.S.
<i>geard</i>, Eng. ‘yard,’ originally any long straight twig
or rod, came to mean: (1) a yard or ell-measure, (2) a
rod measure of land, lineal or superficial. The French
verge is still thus used in Normandy and the Channel
Islands. Our ‘yard’ acquired this extended sense, and
others still more extended. In Cornwall 2 staves (of
9 feet) make a yard of land. In Somerset the lineal
rod is the ‘land-yard,’ and the yard of land is a square
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>rod. Thus the rood is ‘forty yard o’ ground’ and
the acre is ‘eight score yard o’ ground.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Rood.</span>—A differentiated form of ‘rod’ applied in
a lineal sense to 40 rods, and also to the area of a
quarter-acre 40 × 1 rods.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Normandy and the Channel Islands our rod and
rood are verge and vergée, and as the first sense of
verge was ‘yard’ so vergée became in English a ‘yard
of lande.’ So here we have a third sense of the triple-form
word virga-verge-yard.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘A rodde of land which some call a roode, some a
yarde lande, and some a farthendale’ (Recorde, 1542).</p>

<p class='c014'>The latter term, meaning a ‘fourth part,’ as in the
farthing to the penny, may also have referred to the
rood as being a farthing-land in rental. It appears as
L. <i>furendellus</i>, <i>farundel</i>, <i>ferling</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>The rood was also divided into 4 day’s-work, each of
10 square rods.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Acre.</span>—As the rood was sometimes lineal, though
usually superficial, so also the ‘acre’ was sometimes
a rough lineal measure, generally an acre-breadth, or
4 rods (a cricket-pitch). But it might also be an
acre-length = a rood length. The verse in 1 Samuel
xiv.: ‘And that first slaughter which Jonathan and his
armour bearer made was about twenty men within as
it were an half-acre of land which a yoke of oxen
might plow,’ is in Coverdale’s version (1535) ‘within
the length of halve an aker of londe,’ that is,
in a length of 20 rods. In French ‘arpent’ was
likewise used for a French acre-length, reckoned,
not of the official square arpent, but of the furrow-long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>arpent, nearly a furlong. Thus in the Chanson
de Roland</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Einz qu ’hum alast un sul arpent de camp</i></div>
      <div class='line'>(Before one (he) went a single acre of ground)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>evidently means about a furlong, just as in Iliad x.,
‘when he was as far off as the length of the furrow
made by mules’ has the same meaning.</p>

<p class='c014'>Similarly the <i>sesteirado</i> of Provence was used as
an itinerary measure, probably of 100 cano = about
220 yards, the same as the centenié.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>sesteirado</i>, the rood of Southern France,
corresponding to the <i>boisselée</i>, the bushel-land of Mid-France,
was, like the latter, originally a seed-unit, the
extent sown with a <i>sestié</i> of seed-corn. Its extent is
0·4 acre, = our rood. Now if this were square, each
side would measure 40 yards, a length too small for
itinerary measure. Neither Northern nor Southern
France had any official itinerary measure under the
league, so field-units were necessarily used; in the
north the arpent-length, in the south the sesteirado-length;
both corresponding to our rood-length, furrow-length
or furlong. There seems little doubt that the
<i>centenié</i>, the popular itinerary measure of the south,
100 cano or fathoms, was the same as the sesteirado-length.
And the sesteirado being 400 square cano, it
seems that its dimensions were 100 × 4 cano. It was
moreover the rood, or quarter of the greater land-unit,
the <i>saumado</i>, the ‘seam’ of land, which would thus
be 100 × 16 cano just as our rood was 40 × 1 rods,
and our acre 40 × 4 rods. Ten sesteirado-lengths,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>10 centenié, made the <i>milo</i>, a mile of 1000 local fathoms,
one-third of the league of Southern France.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Yardland.</span>—L. <i>quatrona terræ</i>, <i>virgata</i>. Fr. <i>bouvée</i>.
Bovate, Oxgang. About 30 acres more or less, including
pasture and perhaps some woodland. Before the
Norman conquest the gebur-geriht (boor’s right) was
6 sheep and 7 acres arable on his yard-land. This
corresponds roughly to the German <i>hufe</i> = about
20 acres, and to the Netherlands <i>hoeve</i>, the unit of
small holding. Almost everywhere and always, 6 or
7 acres of arable have been all that the boor’s yoke of
oxen can till. There was other work for the oxen
besides ploughing, and at least five ploughings were
usually necessary for proper tillage; then there was
cartage and feudal duties in consideration of the small
rent.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the Roll of Battel Abbey (tenth and eleventh
centuries) the perch is 16 feet; the acre is 40 perches
long and 4 broad and pays a penny a year; 3 shillings
for the virgate or wist, the price of which was about
20 shillings. In this case 8 virgates made a hide, but
this ‘eighth’ is exceptional, for the term ‘virgate’
brought a fourth sense to the virga = yard series of
words, giving rise to the term yard-land as a quarter
of the plough-land or hide. As the vergée in France
(sometimes ambiguously called verge, as it has been
seen that Recorde spoke of ‘a rodde of lande which
some call a roode’) and the rood in England were
a quarter-acre, and as this quarter-acre was sometimes
called a ‘yard of land,’ so virga-verge-yard
acquired the general sense of ‘quarter’—either of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>acre or of a ploughland or carucate. Thus in ‘Quant
une homme est feffe dune verge de terre et dun
autre de un carue du terre’ (Statute of Wards, 1300),
the term ‘verge de terre’ means not a rod, a verge, but
a yardland or virgate.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Farthing’ or ‘ferling’ as a quarter was used in the
same double sense: a quarter-acre or a quarter-hide,
indeed, as will presently be seen, a quarter-virgate.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Acreme.</span>—This old law-term for 10 acres of land
points to a tradition that our original unit of land-measurement
was a rood or furlong square, that is
40 × 40 rods: it was called a Ferlingata or Ferdelh.</p>

<p class='c014'>A document temp. Edw. II describes the virgate (of
which 4 made a hide; 5 hides being a knight’s fee)
as of 4 (square) furlongs, each of 10 acres.</p>

<p class='c015'>X acræ terræ faciunt unam fardellam.</p>

<p class='c015'>Decem acræ faciunt ferlingatam; quatuor ferlingatæ
faciunt virgatam, et quatuor virgatæ faciunt hidam;
quinque hidæ faciunt feodum militis.</p>

<p class='c014'>So it appears conclusive (1) that the hide was 16
square furlongs, a quarter of a square mile = the
quarter section of America; (2) that the acre was
originally a slice of land off the square furlong, a rood,
or furlong in length, a tenth of this in breadth.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Furlong and Ferling.</span>—The square furlong is
the same as the Acreme = 10 acres. The square
furlong or furrow-long tends to become confused with
ferling, G. <i>vierling</i>, with fardel, G. <i>viertel</i>, with farthendale,
Du. <i>vierendeel</i>, all meaning a fourth. This
confusion arises from the square furlong, similar in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>sound to ferling, being approximately the fourth, or
farthing, of the virgate or yardland, itself Ferlingus
terræ, a fourth of the hide or ploughland. So a
ferling may be a fourth of an acre, or of a virgate, or of a
hide. Similarly it may be, as farthendale or farendel,
a quarter-bushel.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another cause of confusion in feudal land-measures
is the money-estimation of land. Bishop Fleetwood
(‘Chronicon,’ 1707) thought the acre was a marc-land of
160 pence and the rod a penny-land, denariatus terræ,
so that the quarter-rod was a farthing-land. He was
deceived by the coincidence of the 160 rods of the acre
with the 160 pence, 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, 8 ounces of silver, of the
monetary marc, and he mistook the Farthingdale or
Farendel, a quarter-acre or rood, for a quarter-rod.
The acre was distinctly a penny-land, and the hide
of 160 acres was a marc-land, paying 160 pence.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Hide.</span>—Ploughland, carucate, L. <i>carucata</i>, Fr.
<i>caruée</i>. Normally 16 square furlongs = 160 acres,
but sometimes 120 acres or less, varying according
to the arable on it; and usually divided into 4 oxgangs,
bovates or yardlands. In some parts the hide seems to
have comprised several ploughlands and to have coincided
with the knight’s fee (see Customs of Lancaster).</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Hundred.</span>—This division of a shire is supposed to
have been originally one hundred hides; more probably
it was a hundred knight’s fees.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>6. <span class='sc'>The Yard and the Verge</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>These cognate terms have many developments of
meaning, running almost parallel both in English and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>French. ‘Yard,’ the equivalent of A.S. gyrd, geard,
and perhaps gæd (gad), is cognate to ‘Rod’ and to
Fr. Verge. It may mean:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. A rod from a tree; L. <i>virga</i>, Fr. <i>verge</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. A short measure of 4 to 6 spans; Fr. <i>verge</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. A pole of indefinite length, in various senses,
naval, &amp;c. Fr. <i>verge</i>, <i>vergue</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. A long measure of 9 to 24 feet = rod, pole,
perch. In France the <i>perche</i> may be from 9-1/2 feet
(Burgundy) to 22 feet (French).</p>

<p class='c014'>5. A measure of surface 9 to 24 feet square. Yard,
Fr. <i>verge</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>6. A larger measure of surface 40 × 1 rod = a
quarter-acre. Yard-land, rood, Fr. <i>vergée</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>7. A quarter of a still larger unit. Virgata,
yard-land.</p>

<p class='c014'>8. A holding of a rood when enclosed became a
yard or garth, then a cultivated enclosure of any size:
tree-yard (Du. <i>boom-gaard</i>), apple-garth, win-gaard
(vineyard).<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Here the Fr. <i>verge</i> parts company with ‘yard’;
its place is taken by <i>cour</i> (L. <i>curtiferum</i>) and
G. <i>hof</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>9. Any enclosed land attached to a house: Palace-yard,
Fr. <i>cour</i>. Farm-yard, Fr. <i>basse-cour</i>. Court-yard,
G. <i>hof</i>. Court = farmyard in Somerset.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fr. <i>verge</i> reappears in the English form of ‘verge’
in the sense of a circle or ring, AS. gyrd, now ‘girth.’
The gyrd was a geard or yard bent into a hoop. Fr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span><i>verge</i> = ring was a verge or rod bent into a hoop or
ring. Cf. Fr. <i>bague</i>, ring made by bending a rod or
baguette into a hoop. The English sense of ‘verge’ =
circle is seen in:</p>

<h3 class='c019'>7. <span class='sc'>How the Rod came to be 5-1/2 Yards</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The Roman pertica was 10 feet; though it seems
probable that there was also a customary rod of
12 feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>The French perche was 6 ells of 4 Roman feet,
double the presumed customary perch of Rome.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Scots rod was 6 ells of 3 Rhineland feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>The German and Norse ruthen are nearly always
either of 12 or of 16 feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>How came it that the English rod was fixed, about
the time of Edward I, at 5-1/2 yards = 16-1/2 feet?</p>

<p class='c014'>There is reason to believe that it was originally
5 yards, at first in Roman feet, then in Rhineland feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>A length of 5 yards and 1 or 2 inches (= 1/(8 × 40)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>of the Roman mile) survives in the Dorsetshire ‘goad’
or ‘lug.’<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c016'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The Cornish rod or yard is 2 staves of 3 yards = 6
yards. There was, as late as 1540, a rod of 6 yards,
‘every pole containing eighten footes of the kinges
standard.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The rod of Guernsey, of Lancashire and of Ireland
is 7 yards; it is the French perche of 20 pieds =
21·36 feet taken roughly at 21 English feet; this, and
the Cheshire rod of 8 yards = 4 fathoms, are probably
of Norman origin.</p>

<p class='c014'>The English rod of pre-Norman and early Norman
times was probably the Teutonic rod of 16 feet, as seen
in the Roll of Battel Abbey. How did it become
16-1/2 feet?</p>

<p class='c014'>I cannot absolutely solve the question; I can only
offer the possible hypotheses:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. That 5-1/2 yards was a compromise between a
Southern rod of 5 yards and a Northern of 6 yards.
But the former length only survived in the Dorsetshire
lug, probably from Roman times, and 16 feet is the
probable length of the Southern rod. And such a
compromise is most improbable. I know of no measure
established as a mean of two different measures.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. That the length of the 5-1/2-yard rod was taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>from that of the medieval lance. Certainly in France
there is some evidence of the spear-length being used
as a rough land-measure, ‘un hanst’ or ‘une hanstée’
de terre. ‘Hanste,’ in modern French <i>hampe</i>, a
shaft, is from L. <i>hasta</i>. Doubtless very long lances
have been used by infantry. The Macedonian phalanx
had lances of 8 yards, so that five rows of spear points
projected from its front. The Scots lance was 6 ells,
the Scots rod, ‘That in all, Spears be six Elns in
length, under the pain of etc.’ (James III); but this
length, = 18-1/2 feet, was ordered two centuries later
than Edward I, at a time when infantry were brought
to resist the onslaught of cavalry. Two centuries
later still, it was ordered by 13 Chas. II that a pikeman
was to be armed with a pike not under 16 feet in length.
It is improbable that in Edward I’s time foot soldiers
were armed with pikes anything like that length, while
the knights’ spears could not have been longer than
10 feet. Those shown in the Bayeux embroidery are
about 7 feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is possible that the length of the ox-goad may
have been used as a rough land-measure, but English
ox-goads appear to have usually been only about the
length of the Cornish goad, not more than 3 yards long.</p>

<p class='c014'>Inclined myself to this second hypothesis—for was
not Hector’s spear of 11 cubits = 22 spans, and are
not 22 spans = 16-1/2 feet?—I yet acknowledge that it
is scarcely tenable.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The most probable hypothesis is that the Rod
was originally a North German Ruthe of 16 Norse or
Rhineland feet brought over by Saxons or Danes, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>that, established as is seen by the Roll of Battel Abbey
‘pertica vero xvi pedes,’ it was afterwards adjusted
to the standard of the King’s foot. Thus 16 Rhineland
feet = 16 feet 5·7 inches; which would make the
statute rod practically 16 feet 6 inches. In North
Germany the Ruthe is usually of 16 local feet, originally,
it may be presumed, Rhineland feet, displaced by the
local foot = 11·23 to 11·5 inches. Sometimes this fall
in the length of the foot is compensated by an increase
in the number of ruthen to the ‘morgen’ or acre, sometimes,
as in Holland, by making the <i>roede</i> 13 Amsterdam
short feet (of 11 inches) instead of 12 Rhineland feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>It seems likely that the North German acker of
160 square ruthen came to Northern France with the
Franks and the Normans, that it became the Acre de
Normandie of 160 square rods, the length of the rod
becoming changed by the influence of the French
standard of 6 <i>aunes</i> = 24 Roman feet. This length
of 24 feet passed, under Norman influence, to Cheshire,
becoming the local rod of 8 yards or 24 English feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>The rod of 6 <i>aunes</i>, French ells, passed to Scotland
as 6 ells, but 6 Scots ells = 18 Rhineland feet.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>8. <span class='sc'>How the Acre came to be 160 Rods</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The North German acker or morgen is 160 ruthen.
Why? It may be presumed that, on the sexdecimal
system dear to the bucolic mind throughout the world,
it was 16 times an original unit of 10 square ruthen, of
16 feet square, analogous to the Greek plethron of
10 square kalamoi and to the Provençal <i>cosso</i> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>10 square fathom-rods. There is still extant, in North
Holland, the <i>snees</i>, snick, or score, of land, = 20 square
roede.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Austrian joch is 1600 square ‘klafter’ of
6 feet = 1·42 acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are 1600 square rods in our square furlong,
the original square unit of which the acre is a one-tenth
slice.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Provence, the people, long under Roman influence,
are yet much more Greek than Roman, and
there is not a trace of any Roman standard among
their weights and measures. There the greater land-unit
is the saumado of 1600 square cano of 6 feet. It
is divided in two ways: (1) on the sexdecimal system,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
(2) into 160 cosso, each of 10 square cano.</p>

<p class='c014'>It seems as if the 1600 small units in our square
furlong, in the Austrian joch, in the Provençal saumado,
come from an extension of the sexdecimal multiple
16 to 160 and 1600.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>9. <span class='sc'>Customs of Lancaster</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>‘Customs of places doe differ; for in the Dutchy of
Lancaster a knightes fee containeth foure hides of
land, every hide foure ploughlands called in latine
carucata terræ, and that is quantum aratrum arare
potest in æstivo tempore, and that is (as I take it)
which is in the North parts called an Oxegange. And
every ploughland or carue is foure yard land which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>in latine is called quatrona terræ; every yardland
thirty acres, halfe a yard land in some places in the
West is called a Cosset, half a Cosset is a Mese which
containeth about 7-1/2 acres. But commonly a carue or
plow-land containeth a hundreth and twenty acres;
a hide of land 480 acres and every knightes fee 1920
acres. But after some computations, a knights fee
containeth five hydes of land, every hyde foure yard
land, and every yard land twenty foure acres.’ (‘The
Surveior’s Dialogue,’ by J. Norden, ‘at my poore
house at Hendon, 27 Martis 1610.’)</p>

<p class='c014'>So in Domesday Book it will be found that ‘inter
Ripe et Mersham,’ between the Ribble and the Mersey,
the hide was not synonymous with the carucate.
The series of feudal measures appears to have been
there:</p>

<p class='c024'>Acre, of Lancashire standard = 1·62 statute acres.</p>

<p class='c024'>Bovate or Virgate of about 15 acres, paying about
4 pence ‘relief’ to the king.</p>

<p class='c024'>Carucate or Ploughland, of 8 bovates, paying about
32 pence.</p>

<p class='c024'>Hide of 6 carucates, paying about one pound.</p>

<p class='c014'>These feudal measures were evidently vague and
variable. The King’s assessment was very much the
same as it was in Upper Burma fifty years ago. There
no survey was required; the land-tax (very light, as
the king’s revenue was derived, as in medieval England,
from forest and other monopolies and from fines) was
one rupee a plough, that is for a plough and a yoke
of cattle. The Norman kings’ assessment was for the
common plough of the whole carucate, 4 oxgangs.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h3 class='c019'>10. <span class='sc'>Seed-measures of Land</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'>When men, emerging from the pastoral stage, took
to agriculture, land was plentiful and would roughly
but conveniently be estimated by the quantity of
seed-corn required for it. Thus seed-units of land
were the earliest, and many survive to this day.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was ordered in Israel (Lev. xxvij.) that land
should be ‘estimated according to the seed thereof, an
homer of barley-seed shall be valued at fifty shekels
of silver.’ Taking the homer at 8 bushels, a homer of
land = 3 or 4 acres, was worth 50 shekels, or half-crowns,
of silver.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Romans had the modius of land, sown with a
modius, about 1/4 bushel, of corn.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Northern France there is still the <i>bonnier</i> of
land, about 4 acres, sown with a <i>boune</i> or <i>bounie</i> of
seed, about 8 bushels.</p>

<p class='c014'>Throughout the greater part of France the land is
reckoned in <i>seterées</i> or <i>sesteirado</i>, units now fixed but
originally named after the variable <i>setier</i> of seed-corn.</p>

<p class='c014'>Smaller units are the <i>mine</i> or <i>eiminado</i>, and <i>boisselée</i>,
all seed-units.</p>

<p class='c014'>In North Germany the Scheffel, or Schepel (Du.),
corn-measure is also a land-measure of about half an
acre. The Schepel passed from Holland to New
England as the Skipple, a bushel-skip. In North
Germany and Norway there is the Tunn or Tonde, a
barrel of about 4 bushels, corresponding to the Tondeland
of about 1-1/3 acre (roughly equal to the French
<i>estrée</i>).</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>To the Salma of Italy, to the Saumado (she-ass
load) of Provence, corresponds the old English Seam,
the Quarter of corn. The word seam hence got the
general meaning of a quarter. So although the Seam
of Corn would sow 4 acres, a seam of an acre meant
a quarter-acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘A Sester or Sextarius was what we call a Quarter
or a seam containing 8 bushels (Sauma, quod unius
equi fit sauma, i.e. sarcina)’ (Bishop Fleetwood, 1707).</p>

<p class='c014'>There are still traces of seed-measures to be found
in some parts of England. But in ‘A pek of londe’—‘Half
 a pek and a nayle of londe’ (Rolls of Parliament,
1442),<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c016'><sup>[21]</sup></a> it is doubtful whether the peck of land was
really a seed-measure or a quarter-acre, as the peck
is a quarter-bushel. A nail of land would be 1/16
acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>There were seed-measures of land in Scotland.
Thus: ‘15th Cy. Chart Aberd. Als mekill land as a
celdr of aits will schawe,’ i.e. a Chalder of land, as
much as a chalder = 64 firlots = 55 bushels, will sow,
about 25 acres. There was also the Lippy of land,
that which took a lippy, 1/16 firlot of seed. It was
usually about 100 square yards.</p>

<p class='c014'>In many parts of Southern Europe there are no
other kinds of land-measure than those derived from
the corn-measures of seed required.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus in Provence, the earliest civilised country in
medieval times, the whole series of corn-measures
and land-measures have names in common.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>ENGLISH COMMERCIAL WEIGHTS</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c019'>I. <span class='sc'>The Story of Averdepois</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The story of our Imperial system has hitherto been
utterly obscure. The origin of our foot, our gallon,
our pound, indeed of all our measures, was quite
unknown. That of the pound, which gives the key
to the whole system, had been obscured by statutes
which ignored any but the royal pound used at the
mints. Yet these statutes, often purposely obscure,
can be made to show the hidden sources of our
system.</p>

<p class='c014'>Our pound, settled at its present Imperial standard
in the time of Queen Elizabeth, was then found to have
risen slightly since the time of Edward III. It was
found to have increased by about 8 grains. The ounce,
now = 437-1/2 grains, had been 437 grains, the same
weight as the ounce of Egypto-Roman pound, the
Roman libra.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c016'><sup>[22]</sup></a> There is every reason to believe that
this Roman standard passed to Britain, and that the
libra, raised to 16 ounces, became the commercial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>pound, afterwards known as Averdepois, and now the
Imperial pound.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the Romans took the Alexandrian talent as
the standard of their new libra-system, they divided
it into 125 libræ, which were 1500 ounces or double-shekels,
each ounce = 437 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the Arab Caliphs conquered the southern
and eastern Mediterranean countries, they found in
Egypt the Egypto-Roman pound, 1/125 of the Alexandrian
talent; they adopted it, and divided it for
coin-weight purposes into 72 mithkals, just as the
Roman Emperors had divided the old As pound into
72 aurei; so 6 mithkals = the libra-ounce of 437
grains, just as 6 aurei = the As-ounce of 420-2/3 grains.
It is not improbable that the survival of the Roman
commercial pound in Saxon England was strengthened
by commercial and scientific relations with the Moors
of Spain. King Offa of Mercia struck a gold coin with
an Arabic inscription, dated 157 of the Hejira = <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 774.</p>

<p class='c014'>However this may have been, there seems no doubt
that the Roman pound, raised to 16 ounces, was the
standard of England before as after the Norman
conquest, and there is no evidence of it having ever
been in abeyance. In early Plantagenet times there
was a sexdecimal series of weights:</p>

<p class='c014'>The Stone of 16 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Wey of 16 stone = 256 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was also the Hundredweight, of which 20
made a ton of 2000 lb.; and 20 weys made a Last of
approximately 5120 lb. or 2-1/2 tons.</p>

<p class='c014'>The pound was divided into 16 ounces, each = 437
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>grains, and the ounce into 16 drams or drops = 27·3
grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>Both before and after the Conquest there was
another pound used in the mints, like the As in Rome.
It was of Tower, or Cologne-marc, standard. There
were doubtless many local variations of commercial
standard, especially in measures of capacity, and it
was the necessity of checking these which made King
John and his successors declare that ‘there should be
one standard throughout our kingdom, whether in
weights or in measures.’</p>

<p class='c014'>But the king had a mint-pound of his own, and he
had to reconcile the existence of the coinage-pound
and of the commercial pound with the customary
declaration of unity of weight made in each reign. The
king’s councillors evaded the difficulty by pretending
that the measures of capacity were based on the mint-pound
and, in statutes where a commercial pound had
to be mentioned, by pretending that this was equal
to 25 shillings weight or 15 ounces of the mint-pound.
This deception led to others, so that, to make out the
meaning of a statute of weights and measures, one
must be able to read between the lines, and to be
prepared for misleading and contradictory statements.
I will take as an instance, Act 51 Henry III (1267):</p>

<p class='c015'>An English peny called a Sterling, round and without
clipping, shall weigh 32 wheat corns in the midst of the
ear; and 20 d. do make an Ounce, and 12 Ounces one
Pound, and 8 Pounds do make a gallon of wine and
8 gallons of wine do make a London Bushel which is the
eighth part of a Quarter.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>This declaration may be thus interpreted:</p>

<p class='c014'>In the Tower there is a standard pound. An
English silver penny should weigh 1/240 of this pound and
1/20 of its ounce, and the penny-weight may be divided
into 32 aces or little grains. But there is another
old-established pound used for all goods but gold and
silver, bread and drugs. Our regard for the unity of
weight forbids us to describe this pound otherwise
than by mentioning that a wine-gallon contains 8 of
these pounds weight of wine or of water, that 8 larger
gallons each containing 8 pounds, not of wine, but of
wheat, make a Bushel; and that 8 of these bushels
make a quarter of a Chaldron containing a ton or
2000 lb. of wheat.</p>

<p class='c014'>That this is correct is easily proved.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Bushel is 1/8 of the Quarter, which was the
quarter of a chaldron, the measure of a ton of 20 true
hundredweight. The quarter was 500 lb. of average
wheat, and the bushel weighed 500/8 = 62-1/2 averdepois
lb. of wheat or, in wheat-water ratio, 78 lb. of wine or of
water, the specific gravity of which differs but little.
But 8 × 8 Tower lb. of wine = (5400 grs. × 8 × 8)/7000
= 49·4 averdepois lb. or, to be quite accurate, 49·5 lb. of
early Plantagenet averdepois weight, when the ounce
was of Roman standard, 437 grains; how then could
the bushel = 78 lb. of wine, be the measure of 49·5 lb.
of wine?</p>

<p class='c014'>That there were two different gallons, the one for
wine, the other for corn, is shown in the Ordinance
31 Edw. III, where it is ordered that ‘8 lb. of wheat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>shall make a gallon.’ It is true that this is continued by
‘the lb. shall contain 20 s.’; but very soon after the
ordinance states that, for everything except groceries,
each lb. shall be of 25 s., and we know that the 25 s.
was merely a subterfuge to show the averdepois pound
as 15 ounces Tower, afterwards 15 ounces Troy,
neither of which it ever was: we may therefore
dismiss this statement, and recognise that the wine-gallon
held approximately 8 averdepois lb. of wine, and
that the corn gallon, about one-fourth larger, held
8 averdepois lb. of wheat.</p>

<p class='c014'>Further evidence is to be found in 12 Henry VII
(1496).</p>

<p class='c014'>This statute, after the usual preamble about ‘one
weight and one measure,’ orders:</p>

<p class='c015'>That the measure of a Bushel contain 8 gallons of
wheat, and that every Gallon contain 8 lb. of wheat of
Troy weight, and every Pound contain 12 ounces of Troy
weight, and every Ounce contain 20 sterlings and every
Sterling be of the weight of 32 Corns of wheat that grew
in the midst of the ear of wheat according to the old law
of the land.</p>

<p class='c014'>While the bushel is now described as containing
8 gallons of wheat and each gallon 8 pounds of wheat,
the old fiction is kept up that these are royal pounds.
Only these pounds are now Troy, of 5760 grains,
instead of Tower, of 5400 grains; 64 Troy pounds
were equal to 52-2/3 lb. averdepois, a weight still far from
the 62-1/2 lb. averdepois of wheat contained in the
extant bushel-measure of Henry VII. And though
the mints were coining 420, instead of 240, pennies from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the 5760 grain-pound of silver, so that these were
little more than half the weight of Henry III’s pennies,
yet they were still of the weight of 32 wheat-corns.</p>

<p class='c014'>The substance of this statute was embodied in a
State-document adorned with a picture of the King’s
Steward presiding over the gauging of bushels and
weighing of wheat-corns, surmounted by a picture of
two entwined wheat-ears with the inscription:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The whete eare. Two graynes maketh the xvi p<sup>te</sup>. of
a penny, ffower graynes maketh the viij p<sup>te</sup>. of a penny.</p>

<p class='c014'>After this impudent assertion one is not surprised
to read that it was ‘the same tyme ordeired that xvi
uncs of Troie maketh the Haberty poie a pounde for to
buy spice<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a> by,’ nor by the statement that ‘the C is
true at this daye, ffyve score for the hundred as
appeareth in Magna Carta.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Comment on these ingenious statements seems
hardly necessary.</p>

<p class='c014'>The only changes in English weights since the time
of Henry III, or indeed much earlier times, have been:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. The raising of the hundredweight to 112 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. The lowering of the stone from 16 lb. to 14 lb.
to make it one-eighth of the new hundredweight.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The rise of the averdepois pound from 16 Roman
ounces of 437 grains to 16 ounces of 437-1/2 grains; a
difference of 8 grains, so as to make it 7000 grains of the
Tudor Troy pound.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>4. The re-legalising of the 100 lb. or cental weight
in 1879.</p>

<p class='c014'>I may observe that the octonary series of measures
of capacity, also of the 14 lb. stone and new Cwt., is
quite in harmony with the sexdecimal system, however
objectionable be those units.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Recognition of Averdepois Weight</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>It is not until 1485 (Ripon Ch. Acts, quoted in the
‘New English Dictionary’) that we find mention of
averdepois, though there had been standard weights
of it from temp. Edw. III, ‘per balance cum ponderibus
de haberdepase,’ and those standards were extant
in the time of Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='c014'>The document embodying 12 Henry VII (1496)
mentions, as has been seen, the Habertypoie pound,
with the assertion that it was 16 Troy ounces, an
assertion causing confusion for centuries afterwards.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Arnold’s ‘Customs of London,’ <i>c.</i> 1500, there is
mentioned ‘the Lyggynge Weyght, by which is boughte
and solde all maner of marchaundise as tynne, ledde
... and al maner of specery ... and such other as
is used to be solde by weyght; and of this weyght
xvj uncis make a pound, and C and xij li. is an C,
and x C make a M of all suche marchaundises ...
except wulle.’</p>

<p class='c014'>This ‘lying weight’ was by the balance, the weight
lying in one scale, and not hanging or sliding on the
beam of a stilyard as in Auncell weight. The stilyard,
very portable, as not requiring heavy weights, yet
admitted of fraud. Arnold says ‘this weight is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>forboden in England by statute of parlement, and
also holy church hath cursed in England all that beyen
or sellen by that auncel weyght.’</p>

<p class='c014'>In 1532 it was ordered by 24 Henry VIII that meat
‘shall be sold by weight called Haver-du-pois,’ and in
1543 Recorde (‘Ground of Artes’) says, ‘But commenly
there is used an other weyght called haberdyepoyse
in which 16 onces make a pounde.’</p>

<p class='c014'>In 1545 the Custom-House notified that ‘thys
lyinge and Habardy peyse is all one.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Having cleared away, as I hope, the obscurity
which so long hung over the commercial weight
ignored by the statutes, it may be well to mention
that ‘Averdepois’ is the best spelling of this word,
and is so accepted by the ‘New English Dictionary.’
‘Aver’ is an old-established English word for ‘goods,’
and the earlier form ‘Haberdepase’ shows the
original pronunciation. The spelling of the last
syllable in ‘Averdepois’ is a sufficient concession to
an incorrect modern custom.</p>

<p class='c014'>The term originally applied to heavy goods, such
as came from beyond sea; if the word was sometimes
spelt, as in 25 Edw. III, ‘bledz, avoirdepois, chars,
pessons’ (corn, heavy goods, meat, fish), it does not
follow that the <i>oi</i> diphthong was pronounced as in
‘boy.’ The word <i>pessons</i>, now written <i>poissons</i>,
shows the sound-value of the diphthong. The sound
now given to it in modern French is a corruption. Up
till 1700, even in Paris, <i>oi</i> was pronounced <i>é</i> or <i>wé</i>.
‘Averdepez’ is the true pronunciation. However,
the influence of ‘poise’ prevents any improvement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>on the word being written and pronounced as
‘Averdepois.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Though measures of capacity had always been on an
averdepois basis, the admission of averdepois weight
to statute recognition only dates from the time of
Elizabeth. In her reign light begins to appear in our
system of weights and measures. In 1574 she ordered
a jury to examine the standard weights (many of
Edward III and succeeding kings), to report on them,
and to construct standards ‘as well of troy weight
as of the avoirdupois.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The standards made by this jury were as unsatisfactory
as their report. Little could be expected from
persons who could, with Edward III’s standard
weights before them, report that ‘the lb. weight of
avoirdepoiz weight dothe consiste of fiftene ounc troie.’
This was in accordance with the old fiction that the
averdepois pound must be a commercial offshoot of
the royal pound, that it was 15 ounces Tower = 6750
grains, and afterwards in Tudor times 15 ounces Troy
= 7200 grains, or even 16 ounces Troy = 7680 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>Elizabeth and her advisers were not deceived by this
obsequious report, so, the standards made being found
very erroneous, in 1582 a second and more intelligent
jury of goldsmiths and merchants was appointed, and
the result of their work was the production of 57 sets of
standard Troy and averdepois weights, which were
distributed to the Exchequer, to cities and towns.
Some of these averdepois weights are still extant and
do not now differ by more than one grain in each pound
from Imperial standard.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>The Proclamation for Weights of December 16, 1587,
established averdepois weight, and ordered that ‘no
person shall use any Troy weight but only for weighing of
bread, gold, silver and electuaries and for no other thing.’</p>

<p class='c014'>It seems probable that, in the two centuries before
Elizabeth, the standard of the commercial pound had
risen by about 8 grains. This may have occurred
when the Troy pound superseded the Tower pound.
In the adjustment, which I assume as probable, of the
Troy and Averdepois pounds so as to obtain a ratio
of 5760 to 7000, the latter standard, raising the ounce
from 437 to 437-1/2 grains, and the pound by 8 grains,
may have been adopted so as to avoid or diminish the
cutting down of the new Troy pound.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus was established by Elizabeth the English
standard of weight. Excellent standards of capacity
and of length were also made; and she established
our silver coinage on its present basis.</p>

<p class='c014'>And yet, well into the nineteenth century, even into
the twentieth, went on the puzzledom of our weights
and measures, left to arithmetic book and almanack
makers blinded by the glamour of the royal pound.</p>

<p class='c014'>No official utterance came to clear the darkness,
for it was not till 1855 that the pound, then established
as an Imperial standard, was really defined.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>The Imperial Pound</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>It is the weight in vacuo of a certain piece of platinum
kept in London. It is divided into 16 ounces,
approximately Roman ounces. The ounce may be
divided into 16 drams.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>The pound is also divided into 7000 grains, the
ounce being 437-1/2 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>It may be well to anticipate or remove any uncertainty
about the grain. The averdepois pound was
only divided into ounces and drams (just as the yard
is only divided, as a yard, into quarters and nails),
but on its adjustment with the troy pound as =
7000 grains of which the latter = 5760, it became
divisible into grains. These were long called Troy
grains, in consequence of the superstition about the
noble Troy weight. This word seems to have paralysed
the intelligence of many persons doubtless sensible
enough in other matters; thus Rees’ ‘Cyclopædia’
(1819) informed its readers that ‘the pound or 7680
grains avoirdupois equals 7000 grains troy, and hence
1 grain troy equals 1·097 avoirdupois.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The weight of the standard pound in a vacuum
(that is, its weight not diminished by the buoyancy
of the air) being 7000 grains, a commercial brass
pound exactly equal to the platinum standard when
weighed against it in air at 62°, would weigh 7000·6
grains in a vacuum.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Dram</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>This, 1/16 of an ounce = 27-1/3 grains, is principally
used as a unit for powder in the cartridges of sporting
guns. In Scotland it was called a ‘drop.’</p>

<p class='c014'>1673. A quech weighing 18 unce and 10 drop.</p>

<p class='c014'>1805. An arrow of from 20 to 24 drop weight
(‘N.E.D.’).</p>

<p class='c014'>The dram was possibly so called from its corresponding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>to the quentchen, 1/8 of the German Loth or half-ounce
(1/16 of a marc) as the drachm was 1/8 of a medicinal
ounce.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Or it may merely have been called a dram
as being the part of the ounce, in the same way that
the drachm was the next lower part of the apothecaries’
ounce.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>Scientific and Medicinal Divisions of the Pound</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>For scientific purposes the pound is considered as
of 7000 grains. It may be divided into tenths,
hundredths, thousandths; this last division being
called a Septem, as = 7 grains. The tenth of this
might be called a Septula = 0·7 grain, and the hundredth
a Septicent = 0·07 grain. This small weight
would be one 100,000th of the gallon, the same proportion
as the centigramme to the litre. In analyses
of water the solid constituents are usually stated in
centigrammes to the litre, or parts in 100,000; and as
grains to the gallon or parts in 70,000 they have to be
divided by 0·7 to get that ratio. Septicents to the
gallon would be the English equivalent of centigrammes
to the litre.</p>

<p class='c014'>An Apothecaries’ Troy ounce lingers in the Board
of Trade list of standards, for a permissive use utterly
unrequired by medical prescribers or by druggists;
the British Pharmacopœia only recognising Imperial
weight, the ounce and the grain. For convenience, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>weight of 60 grains is called a Drachm, and one of
20 grains is called a Scruple. It is most rare for
prescriptions to contain an ounce of any solid medicine;
and when an ounce of such a medicine is most exceptionally
prescribed, it might be an Imperial ounce,
just as ounces of fluid medicines prescribed are Imperial
ounces.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>4. <span class='sc'>The Long Hundredweight</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The multiples of the pound were originally, like
its divisions, in a sexdecimal series, with an alternative
series to bring in the hundredweight, i.e. the true
Cwt.</p>

<p class='c014'>The approximative relation of the quarter, strictly
speaking of 512 lb., mattered but little, as it applied
to corn-measure, in which the measured quarter,
8 bushels, varied from 500 lb. for wheat of 62-1/2 lb. to
the bushel, to 512 lb. for heavy wheat of 64 lb. to the
bushel. The arrangement was convenient for the corn-trade
and could not give rise to fraud; and the main
object of all laws on weights and measures should be to
prevent fraud, especially in retail trade.</p>

<p class='c014'>This convenient arrangement was altered in the
times of Edward I and Edward III. The former King
found the Cwt. of 100 lb. with a quarter of 25 lb. and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>sixteenth = 6-1/4 lb. as its nail or clove. In his Acts
there is mention of the 100 weight, the 1000 weight,
the 2000 weight. But by the Ordinance of Measures
31 Edw. I, 1302, a distractingly obscure statute, no
less than three different weights are ordered for the
stone:</p>

<p class='c014'>A stone for lead of 12 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>A London stone of 12-1/2 lb., one-eighth of the true
Cwt.</p>

<p class='c014'>A stone for groceries of 8 lb.; and 13-1/2 stone to
make a Cwt. of 108 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>And the ‘fotmal’ of lead is to be 6 stones of 12 lb.
but less 2 lb., ‘which are 70 lb. making 5 stones.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Here then we see, besides a 12 lb. stone for lead,</p>

<p class='c024'>(<i>a</i>) The true Cwt. of 100 lb. divided into quarters
and nails.</p>

<p class='c024'>(<i>b</i>) A transitional Cwt. of 108 lb. in 13-1/2 old half-stones
of 8 lb.</p>

<p class='c024'>(<i>c</i>) A new Cwt. of 112 lb. in 8 stones of 14 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Cwt. (centena) of 108 lb. seems to have been
preparatory to the Cwt. of 112 lb. mentioned in this
Ordinance (if it be not a later interpolation) and
established later by Edward III. It preserved, for
a time, the ancient half-stone of 8 lb., but by the
inconvenient process of making 13-1/2 of these as the
Cwt.; probably to prepare the merchant for a new
Cwt. of 112 lb. first in 14 stones of 8 lb. and then in
8 stones of 14 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is the Cwt. which has come down from Edward
III to the present day, against which trade has had to
struggle more or less successfully ever since, and which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>torments the schoolboy with sums in tons, cwts., qrs.
and lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>To this day the old Stone of 16 lb. or its half, the
Clove of 8 lb., still continues in use. The butcher’s
and fishmonger’s stone is 8 lb., and cheese is sold, in
most parts of England, by the 16 lb. stone, as it was
five or six centuries ago. In 1434, by 9 Henry VI, it
was ordered that the Wey of cheese should contain 32
cloves, yet we learn from Arnold (1500) that the weight
of Suffolk Cheese is xij score and xvj lb., the same
weight as the wey (16 × 16 = 256 lb.), and Recorde
(1543) says that for butter and cheese ‘a clove containeth
8 lb. and a wey 32 cloves which is 256 lb.’ By
10 Anne (1712) a barrel of soap is to contain 256 lb.,
i.e. a Wey.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Plantagenet 14 lb. stone is used for flour and
potatoes, &amp;c., but the load, the modern form of the
wey, is 18 stone of 14 lb. = 252 lb., evidently an
approximately near substitute for the 16 × 16 lb. =
256 lb. of the Wey, there being until quite recently no
lawful weights allowed above 7 lb. but in multiples of
that weight. The load, like the wey, has the advantage
of being equal to 4 bushels of heavy corn at 63 lb., so that
it is half of the Quarter and an eighth of the wheat-chaldron
or ton-measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>What was the reason for the Plantagenet Cwt.?
for the inconvenient unit, rightly rejected by our
brethren in North America, and in several colonies?</p>

<p class='c014'>Edward I’s intermediate Cwt. of 108 lb. seems to
show that it was intended to bring our Cwt. up to that
of foreign countries using Troy pounds, 108 lb. being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>very close to the French and Flemish quintal (Arabic
cantar) of 100 Troy lb. The wool-trade with Flanders,
the dominion of the Plantagenets in France, may
have been the motives for this increase.</p>

<p class='c014'>The hypothesis that the Cwt. was made 112 lb. so as
to be equal to 100 long Troy lb. of 16 Troy ounces, is
excluded by the ratio of averdepois to long troy being
100 to 109·7 and also by the new Cwt. dating at least
from the time of Edward III, when the royal lb. was
still Tower, not Troy, with a ratio to averdepois of 100
to 128; and it was certainly not of 16 ounces.</p>

<p class='c014'>The only lawful multiples of the Imperial pound
were, until quite recently, those of the stone series:</p>

<p class='c014'>And the only lawful weights were those of 56, 28,
14, 7, 4, 2, and 1 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have had some personal experience of the inconvenience
of these weights. For years I had to weigh
recruits and other soldiers, recording their weights
in pounds with this inconvenient set of weights. To
get the weight of a man of 152 lb. I had to reckon 2 ×
56 lb. + 28 + 7 + 4 + 1 lb. Errors were necessarily
frequent when many weighings had to be rapidly done,
so I had a set of decimal weights made—20, 10, 5 lb.—and
all trouble ceased. But these weights were not
lawful, at least for trade purposes.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>There was, however, another lawful unit, the
Cental, that is, the original English Cwt., brought back
to England from North America by the corn-trade.
Commerce demanded the recognition of the Cental
and got it in 1879.</p>

<p class='c014'>In 1902, the tobacco-trade in Liverpool, annoyed
at the inconvenience of the lawful units of weight, as
inconvenient for the wholesale tobacco-warehouse as
for my military purposes, moved the Liverpool Chamber
of Commerce to get the Board of Trade to allow them to
use a half-cental weight; a whole cental, the only
lawful unit of the kind, being too heavy for handling.
In reply to this request, it was suggested that a nest of
weights, 28 + 14 + 7 + 1 lb. = 50 lb. might be used.
To this the tobacco-trade objected, and after correspondence,
the use of a 50 lb. weight was granted. Then
they requested permission to use smaller fractions of
the cental, in fact a decimal series of 20, 10, 5 lb. And
they obtained it. So, thanks to the perseverance of
the Liverpool tobacco-merchants and Chamber of
Commerce, the decimal fractions of the Cental are now
lawful weights, and no one need use the inconvenient
14 lb. stone series.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>5. <span class='sc'>Wool and Lead Weight</span></h3>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Wool Weight</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The revenue of the Plantagenet kings being largely
derived from duties on the export of wool, the weight of
the sack was fixed by statute. By 31 Edw. I ‘the
sack of wool ought to weigh 28 stone of 12-1/2 lb.’ =
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>350 lb. By 14 Edw. III ‘the sack shall contain
26 stone and each stone 14 lb.’ = 364 lb., i.e. 2 weys of
13 stone. This regulation was supported by other
statutes, in 1389 and 1496, and appears to have had
due effect, for it is the standard at the present time:
26 stone or 13 ‘tods.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Why was this particular weight ordered?</p>

<p class='c014'>Possibly because the sack thus corresponded
nearly to the skippund (ship-pound) of the Baltic
trade and of Scotland, a weight of 20 lispund each of
16 Norse Troy pounds or of 20 pounds of light standard
= 352 to 375 lb. The Baltic skippund at the present
day is about 350 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Scotland the sack of wool was ordered to be
24 stone, which was equivalent to 26 English stone, in
proportion to the heavier weight of the Scots pound.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Plantagenet domination in France caused the
stone to pass there, though not always at English
weight; and there being no regular weight in France
between the pound and the quintal, local stones came
into use. ‘Les laines vend on par sacs et par pois,
par pierres, par claus et par livres,’ the French terms
for the sack, the wey, the stone, the clove and the
pound.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c016'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Sometimes the stone was called ‘gal’ (stone,
<i>galet</i>, shingle) and the clove ‘demi-gal’ (Livre blanc
de l’hotel de ville d’Abbeville). The French stone was
of variable weight. One record gives the sack of wool
(= 4 Montpellier light quintals) as of 25 pierres, which
would make them 9 lb. each. Another record gives it
as 36 stone of 9 standard pounds (= 10 English pounds).</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>The stone appears to be extinct now in France; I
find that as late as 1579 wool was sold in Burgundy by
the wool-stone (<i>la pierre de laine</i>) = 12 French or about
13 English pounds.</p>

<p class='c014'>While the old English wey or load was 16 × 16 =
256 lb., the wey ordered for wool was half a sack =
182 lb. It would seem that, once the King’s dues paid,
the shipper was free to make up his sacks or sarplers
of wool as most convenient to him. The customary
wey or weigh (Sc. waugh or wall) seems to have been
32 cloves or nails of 7 lb. = 2 cwt. A ‘poke’ of wool
‘weand 4 C. 15 nallis,’ i.e. 4 cwt. and 105 lb. A sack
might be ‘6 wall and 25 naill,’ i.e. 12 cwt. and 175 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>The wey or weigh became, in statute French, <i>poids</i>,
<i>pois</i>; but the scribes took the wrong <i>pois</i> and thinking
it meant ‘pease’ made it <i>pisa</i> in their Latin, just as
they took the wrong ‘nail’ and made it L. <i>clavus</i>, and
in French <i>clau</i>, through L. <i>clavis</i>, meaning a ‘key.’</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Lead Weight</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>While the fother is 17-2/3 cwt. for coal, it is 19-1/2 cwt.
= 2184 lb. for lead. This peculiar unit, also called
the char or load, is the consequence of a statute 31
Edw. I, perhaps the most confused and bewildering of
the many confused medieval statutes on weights and
measures, and one in which subsequent interpolations
may be suspected. It ordered two stones, one of 12 lb.
and another of 12-1/2 lb., and to keep up the pretence of
there being no weight other than of Tower standard,
it declared that a pound shall contain 25 shillings.
This shilling standard may be put aside.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>The 12 lb. stone is ordered apparently either as
a double of a customary ‘lead-pound’ of 6 lb. or to
make the customary fotmal or ‘pig’ of lead, 70 lb.
weight, ‘contain 6 stones (of 12 lb.) less 2 lb.’ It also
says that the deduction of 2 lb. leaves ‘70 lb. making
5 stones.’ This passage appears to be a subsequent
interpolation after the institution of Edward III’s
14 lb. stone.</p>

<p class='c014'>The fother of lead, of 30 fotmals, would thus be =
2100 lb. But the stone of 12-1/2 lb., evidently intended
to be 1/8 of the true hundredweight, and to pave the
way for the coming 14 lb. stone, is also applied to lead.
How it is not said; but the present fother, = 2184 lb.,
is almost exactly equal to 30 fotmal, each of 73 lb. =
2190 lb.; and 73 lb. is just 6 stone of 12-1/2 lb. less
2 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>The 70 lb. fotmal seems to have disappeared by the
seventeenth century, but in the meantime the uncertainty
of the fother led to the use of Boole-weight,
meaning the weight used at the lead-boles or natural
bowls in which lead ore was smelted. The fother,
boole-weight, was 30 fotmals of 6 stone of 14 lb.
Sometimes it was of 24 fotmals = 2016 lb., that is 18 cwt.</p>

<p class='c014'>The meaning of Fother is given in <a href='#XX'>Chapter XX</a>.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>6. <span class='sc'>Trade-units of Weight</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>It is unnecessary to describe or even name the
various weights peculiar to trade or local custom.
Everyone in the trade knows them; out of it no one
need know them. If a person not in the trade buys a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>cask of wine, a barrel of beer, a sack of flour or a load
of potatoes, commonsense prompts him to ask how
many gallons or pounds are contained in these units.
It is the same in France and other countries of the
metric system, where the cask, the sack, the churnful,
&amp;c., are trade-units with their peculiar equivalents
of litres or kilogrammes. It is indeed by the use of
trade-units that manufacturers evade the rigour of the
metric system.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>ENGLISH MEASURES OF CAPACITY</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c019'>I. <span class='sc'>The Old Wine Measures</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>It has been seen that a cubic foot of water is very
approximately = 1000 Roman ounces = 62-1/2 lb. of
water at the early averdepois standard. There is
reason to believe that this cubic foot was our original
wine-unit, the wine-bushel, 1/8 of it = 216 cubic inches,
being the wine-gallon; and that the cubic foot,
increased in water-wheat ratio 1728 × 1·25 = 2160 c.i.,
was the corn-bushel. The corn-gallon, 2160/8 = 270 c.i.,
remained at this standard for centuries, 268·8 c.i.
being the London measure, and 272-1/4 c.i. the Winchester
measure, the slight differences being due to difficulties
in casting and gauging shallow metal pans.</p>

<p class='c014'>That the wine-gallon was originally 1/8 cubic foot
is rendered very probable by the existence in Ireland
of a gallon of almost exactly that capacity. This
gallon was legalised for ale, beer and spirits by George II
(1735) at a capacity of 217·6 c.i.</p>

<p class='c014'>The rise of the wine-gallon in England to 219 c.i.,
to 224 c.i., and finally to 231 c.i. under Henry VIII,
seems due to two influences:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>1. The desire to make it hold 8 lb. of wine =
about 222 c.i., that weight being mentioned in
statute.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. The influence of wine-measures used at the
ports whence wine came.</p>

<p class='c014'>The principal unit of wine-measure at Bordeaux,
and some other continental ports, was the Velte, the
equivalent of the German viertel which was 1/4 Rhineland
cubic foot = 471·6 c.i. So our gallon tended to
increase towards the measure of 235·8 c.i., the half-velte.
It could not increase further than 231 c.i.
without deranging its water-wheat ratio with the
corn-gallon, already increased, temporarily at least,
under Henry VIII to 282 c.i. But the principal
reason for 231 c.i. was that this was the capacity of a
cylinder 7 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep.
It has always been desirable that market-measures
should be of dimensions easily remembered and
readily gauged with a foot-rule. The wine-gallon of
231 c.i., confirmed by the new measures made by
Elizabeth’s order, was afterwards known as Queen
Anne’s gallon. It is to this day the fluid gallon of
the United States, Canada and Ceylon.</p>

<p class='c014'>The half-velte was the French <i>galon</i>, a word
connected with <i>galloie</i>, <i>jallaie</i>, <i>jalle</i>, <i>jarre</i>, with our
‘jar’ and with ‘gauge,’ Fr. <i>jauge</i>. It may be
mentioned that ‘velte’ sometimes meant a gauging-rod
for wine-casks.</p>

<p class='c014'>The wine-gallon was divided into 2 pots, or 4 quarts
or 8 pints. The wine-pint = 16·57 fluid ounces = 5/6
Imperial pint.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus the hogshead (Flemish <i>okshoofd</i>, ox-head)
was approximately 1/4 of the tun or fluid ton.</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>252 wine-gallons of 8 lb. = 2016 lb.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The customary beer-barrel contained, and still
contains, 36 gallons (now Imperial gallons). It is
probable that it was originally a half-hogshead =
31-1/2 or 32 gallons, and that it rose as an indirect
consequence of the statutory rise of the Cwt.
and Ton. (This will be explained under Corn
Measure.)</p>

<p class='c014'>The half-barrel of 18 gallons was called a Kilderkin,
from the old Flemish word <i>kinderkin</i>, a little child.
To it corresponded the Runlet of 18-1/2 wine-gallons
(1483), the German Eimer or double Anker.</p>

<p class='c014'>The quarter-barrel of 9 gallons is a Firkin, a word
in which <i>vierde</i>, a fourth, replaces <i>kinder</i>; so that
in the fifteenth century it was a Ferdekyn.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the ale-barrel remained nominally at 32 gallons,
its kilderkin at 16, its firkin at 8 gallons. This counterbalanced
the increase of the ale-gallon to 282 c.i. How
did this rise come about? The probable explanation
is that the ale-gallon was really a corn-gallon of
Henry VII and VIII; it disappeared for corn, but
it remained for ale.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>
  <h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>The Ale-gallon</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Henry III proclaimed on his accession that,
according to Magna Charta, there should be but one
standard of measure and of weight throughout the
realm, one measure of wine, one measure of ale, and
one measure of corn.</p>

<p class='c014'>There seems to be no information extant about
the second of these measures; it was presumably
the same as the corn-gallon. A statute of Henry VIII
ordered the barrel of beer to be 36 gallons and that
of ale 32 gallons, whence it may be presumed that
the former were wine-gallons and the latter corn-gallons,
32 and 36 being taken as the whole numbers
nearly proportionate to wine and corn measure, and
admitting of the quarter-barrel being 8 gallons of ale
and 9 of beer.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>In 1496 (temp. Henry VII) a new corn-bushel
was made = 2240 c.i., its gallon being 280 c.i. While
it is possible that this increase was due to inaccurate
casting, yet it might be that the new corn-gallon was
intended to be on a water-wheat ratio with the wine-gallon,
then = 224 c.i. (224 × 1-1/4 = 280), in the same
way that the usual corn-gallon of 270 c.i. was in that
ratio to the original 1/8 cubic foot gallon of 216 c.i.
(216 × 1-1/4 = 270).<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c016'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>In 1531 the corn-gallon was increased to 282 c.i.
But under Elizabeth the corn-gallon was restored to
its old standard of 1/8 bushel = 2150·4/8 c.i. = 268·8 c.i.
and the wine-gallon fixed at 231 c.i. At these standards
both gallons stood until their unification in 1824.
Confirmed by Queen Anne, they are known by her
name.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the corn-gallon of Henry VIII, = 282 c.i.,
remained as the Ale-gallon, probably because it had
become the standard measure for malt.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Quart and Pint</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>While the wine-pint was an eighth of a wine-gallon
the common pint of England was the Ale-pint, an
eighth of the Tudor Ale-gallon, which was 280 or
282 cubic inches and differed little from the Imperial
gallon = 277·27 cubic inches. So the pint of ale in
Tudor times differed little from an Imperial pint.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Quart and Pint of Elizabeth preserved at the
Standards Office are larger than Imperial measure, the
Quart holding 40·53 ounces as compared with the
40 ounces of the Imperial quart; it is one-fourth of a
gallon of 280 cubic inches, the Tudor ale-gallon.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>Corn Measure</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>It has been seen that Henry III’s statute defined
the gallon as containing 8 lb. of wine, and Edward I’s
as containing 8 lb. of wheat. It is probable that the
Magna Charta principle of ‘one weight, one measure’
prevented the mention of two different gallons, as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>prevented the mention of two different pounds. But
we know that there were two gallons. In England as
in ancient Greece the unit of corn-measure was the
fluid measure of the Talent increased in water-wheat
ratio; so our cubic foot, taken as a wine-bushel of 8 wine-gallons,
and increased one-fourth, gave the corn-bushel
of 8 corn-gallons.</p>

</table>
<p class='c014'>of which 1/8 = 270 c.i. was the corn-gallon.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has been seen that the wine-gallon increased to
231 c.i., but the corn-standard remained for centuries
(excepting a vagary temp. Henry VII and VIII) at
very nearly its original value. It must be remembered
how difficult it must have been to cast accurately a
shallow brass pan 18-1/2 inches in diameter and only 8
inches deep; and this is probably the cause of the
slight difference between the two standards of corn-measure,
the London bushel and the Winchester
bushel. These were simply variants, inevitable in
making standard measures of the calculated capacity
of the bushel = 2160 cubic inches = 1-1/4 cubic feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>The London bushel = 2150·42 c.i.; the gallon =
268·8 c.i.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Winchester bushel = 2178 c.i.; the gallon =
272-1/4 c.i.</p>

<p class='c014'>The latter standard was so called, it is said, because
its standard had been kept at Winchester since the
time of King Edgar; it was, by 22 Chas. II (1670) and
10 Geo. III (1769), the standard measure for corn and
other dry goods.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>But by 13 Wm. III (1702) and by 5 Anne (1707)
the London bushel was the standard, and this is the
present corn-bushel of the United States. It is,
however, commonly called, but inaccurately, a Winchester
bushel.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>4. <span class='sc'>The Quarter and the Chaldron</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>When the Cwt. was raised to 112 lb. and the Ton
to 2240 lb. the Chaldron or ton-measure of wheat
was increased by statute from 4 × 8 = 32 bushels
to 36 bushels. One would think it would follow that
the Quarter would be raised from 8 to 9 bushels. No,
it was not raised, by law at least; so the corn-trade
raised it themselves, thinking that evidently if a
chaldron is now 36 bushels, for the quarter of it we
must ask or give 9 bushels.</p>

<p class='c014'>But this practice was apparently held to be an
offence against the repeated royal declarations beginning
with the 32 wheat-corn weight of the penny
and ending with the ‘bushel which is the eighth part
of the Quarter.’ While one statute raised the Chaldron
to 36 bushels, another declared that its quarter was
to remain at 8 bushels. In 15 Rich. II (1391) it is
declared that ‘8 bushels striked should make the
Quarter of corn nevertheless that divers people will not
buy but 9 bushels for the Quarter.’</p>

<p class='c014'>As statutes of 1436 and 1496 repeated this prohibition
of any increase of the quarter one may presume
that the forbidden practice continued, the increased
quarter being called a Vat. But there was another
way of evading these statutes; the old story with bad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>legislation; <i>Fatta la lege, trovato l’inganno</i>. It became
in many parts customary to give, not a long-quarter,
but a long-bushel of 9 gallons, so that 8 long-bushels
would make the new quarter-chaldron. It was possibly
a relic of this practice which caused the Chester corn-measure
to become 70 lb., roughly 62-1/2 lb. × 9/8 =
70·3 lb. Cheshire perhaps benefited by its neighbourhood
to Lancashire, which was specially exempted
by 13 Rich. II from the penalties for offences against
the unity of weights and measures, ‘because in that
county it hath always been used to have greater
measure than in any other part of the realm.’<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c016'><sup>[28]</sup></a> Yet
long-bushels are sometimes the striked equivalents of
heaped measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>But in most parts of the country the attempts to
correct stupid legislation were abandoned, and so the
Chaldron of 36 bushels fell almost out of use and the
Quarter ceased to be a quarter of any measure. In
1707 Bishop Fleetwood (‘Chronicon preciosum’) could
only say ‘doubtless a Quarter is a quarter or fourth
part of some load or weight.’ And there is a story
that Lord Kelvin, asking the head of the Standards
Office (giving evidence before a Royal Commission
on Weights and Measures) of what a Quarter was the
quarter, failed to obtain any light on the subject.
And he himself did not know.</p>

<p class='c014'>But since the corn-trade brought back from North
America the old ton of 20 centals, the quarter has found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>its long-lost father. The freight-ton of ships, 40 cubic
feet of cargo, contains 32 bushels (at 1-1/4 cubic feet to
the bushel), that is 4 Quarters or 2000 lb. of average
wheat = 20 centals.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>5. <span class='sc'>Coal Measure</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The Chaldron of 36 bushels is used for the sale of
coke and in Northumberland for coal.</p>

<p class='c014'>A ‘keel’ of coal, i.e. the load of the Tyneside lighter
known as a ‘keel,’ was, up till the fifteenth century,
20 ‘chaldres,’ the measure of 20 old tons:</p>

</table>

<p class='c014'>When the old Chaldron became illegal it gradually gave
place to the new ton and to the new chaldron. The Newcastle
chaldron was 2 statute chaldrons = 72 bushels.
The modern keel of coal is 21·2 tons = 16 statute
chaldrons of 36 bushels = 8 Newcastle chaldrons.
This double chaldron is then 72 bushels, or, as 1/8 of the
keel, = 21·2 tons, it is 53 cwt., and it is divided into 3
Fother of 17-2/3 cwt. = 1966 lb. or nearly the old ton of
2000 lb. Thus the Newcastle fother is nearly the old
ton, and the keel of 24 fothers or old tons has taken
the place of the sixteenth-century keel of 20 old tons.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the eighteenth century the coal-bushel was
slightly changed from London or Winchester standard.
12 Anne (1714) ordered a special coal-bushel. It was
defined as containing a Winchester bushel and a quart,
33 instead of 32 quarts = 2218 cubic inches, and coal
was to be sold by the chalder of 36 such bushels, heaped.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>This new bushel was 1/8 inch more in diameter and in
depth than the old standard; it arose probably from
a faulty casting. It is remarkable, inasmuch as its
capacity is almost exactly that of the Edinburgh firlot
and also of the Imperial bushel instituted a century
later.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Chaldron survives for coke. When coal is
coked at the gas-works it swells, so that a ton of
coal, = about 3/4 chaldron, yields about a chaldron
of coke.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Heaped Measure</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>It has been seen that in 1392 the bushel was to be
measured ‘striked’ and not heaped. Yet the love
of extra weight or measure is so ingrained in human
nature that it persisted, at least in retail transactions.
With a pan-shaped bushel more than twice as broad as
deep, heaping increased the measure by not less than
one-fourth. With a drum-shaped bushel, its depth
equal to its diameter, the increase of heaped over
striked measure would be about an eighth, so that a
bushel of wheat would weigh about 70 lb. instead of
62 lb. Heaped measure was made illegal in 1835.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is possible that some long-bushels (as that of
Chester = 70 lb.) were originally, or actually, heaped
bushels.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>6. <span class='sc'>The Imperial Gallon</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>In 1824 some of our measures were reorganised,
and among the changes was the unification of wine and
corn measure. The better concordance of capacity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>with weight by a single gallon containing exactly
10 lb. of water at ordinary temperature has been a
great advantage. It has enlarged the decimal capabilities
of our system without impairing its convenient
and popular series of capacity units. It is indeed an
advantage that the slight increase of the corn-gallon
now gives a weight of 64 lb. good wheat to the bushel,
so that the pint corresponds very exactly to a pound of
wheat.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet it must be remembered that our brethren of the
United States, not usually deemed unprogressive, get on
very well with Queen Anne’s wine-gallon and corn-gallon.</p>

<p class='c014'>The new gallon holds exactly 10 lb. of pure water
at 62° or 277·274 cubic inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The bushel is of the capacity of 2218·19 cubic
inches. It holds 80 lb. of pure water.</p>

<p class='c014'>The change from the old corn-gallon was very
slight, increasing it by only 3 per cent., from 268·8 to
277·27 c.i. (and rather less from the Winchester gallon
of 270 c.i.), so that the bushel formerly holding 62-1/2 lb.
of wheat now holds 64 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>Wine-measure was increased by almost exactly 20
per cent., from 231 c.i. to 277·27 c.i., so that a gallon of
wine is contained in 6 customary bottles, instead of 5
as formerly, or as at present in the United States.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bushel measures are of two shapes: the drum-shape,
15 inches diameter by 12-2/4 inches deep, and the
standard shape (that of the old corn-measure), 18-1/2
inches diameter by 8-1/4 inches deep.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nothing has been changed in the excellent octonary
series of measures, pint, gallon, bushel, quarter (eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>of the first making one of the second and so on), with
binary sub-units—some of them general, as the quart;
others local, as the coomb; and some more or less
obsolete, as the tuffet, famous in nursery rhyme.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE MINT-POUNDS</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>The Saxon or Tower Pound</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>At some time before the Norman Conquest the Marc of
Cologne was brought to England, probably only as the
mint-standard of the later English kings, for the 16-ounce
Roman pound was already long-established
as the commercial weight.</p>

<p class='c014'>The standard of the Cologne marc has never varied
much.</p>

<p class='c014'>Its mean weight = 3608 grains; when doubled it
made a pound = 7216 grains, with an ounce = 451
grains. This pound is almost identical with the
greater rotl of Al-Mamūn, 1/100 of the cantar =
102·92 lb.; and the old Prussian pound of Cologne
standard was 1/100 of the Prussian centner = 103·11 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Norman Conquest made no change; the Saxon
pound became the Tower pound, the King’s treasury
or mint being in the Tower of London. The Tower
pound of standard silver was coined into 240 silver
pennies, which, at 22-1/2 grains, their weight down to the
time of Edward III, gives 5400 grains for the pound
and 450 grains for the ounce. An actual weight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>= 5404 grains was found in the Pyx chamber in
1842.</p>

<p class='c014'>The shilling, of 12 pence, was until Tudor times
only money of account. But it was also a weight of
account, the pound being either 12 ounces of 20
pennyweight, or 20 shillings of 12 pennyweight.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘When a quarter of wheat is sold for 12 pence, the
wastel-bread of a farthing shall weigh 6 li. and 16 s.
But bread cocket of a farthing shall weigh more by
2 s.’ (Assize of Bread, 51 Henry III.) That is, the
farthing loaf shall weigh 6-16/20 Tower lb. = 5-1/4 averdepois
lb., and the second sort 24 dwt. or 1-1/5 Tower ounce
more.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here is an instance of the confusion caused by
making bread, like gold, silver and medicines, saleable
only by the royal pound. This system of a peculiar
pound for bread lasted till the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class='c014'>Under Edward I the halfpenny loaf weighed 40 s.,
that is 2 lb. Tower = a little more than 1-1/2 lb. averdepois.</p>

<p class='c014'>Moneyers and goldsmiths divided the dwt. or
original weight of the silver penny, for fine weighing,
on the Dutch system, that is into 2 mayles, 4 ferlings
8 troisken, 16 deusken, 32 azen (aces). This would
account for the 32 wheat-corns which the silver penny
was always supposed to weigh, however many pence
the mint struck from the pound of silver.</p>

<p class='c014'>The mayle and ferling (Fr. <i>maille</i> and <i>felin</i>) were
the mint-names for the silver halfpenny and farthing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Under the gradual influence of Troy weight the
dwt. Tower was also divided into 24 parts or grains.
It was so divided in the time of Edward III.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>It must be remembered that there was absolutely
no definition of Tower weight, nothing but the usual
proclamation about the 32 wheat-corns, a convenient
definition, as they still appeared to balance the penny
when it had fallen to half its original weight.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>The Troy Pound</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The pound of Troie is mentioned in the time of
Henry IV, and in the next reign goldsmiths were
ordered to use <i>la libre de Troy</i>, though by 9 Henry V
mint-rates were still stated in <i>la libre de Tour</i>. By
2 Henry VI the price of standard silver is fixed at
30<i>s.</i> la livre du Troie, which means that 12 × 30 pennies
of 15 grains were being coined from a pound of 5400
grains, evidently still a Tower pound. Notwithstanding
the change of name, the Troy pound was not
proclaimed as the royal pound until 1527, when by
18 Henry VII ‘the pounde Towre shall be no more
used, but all manner of golde and sylver shall be wayed
by the pounde Troye which excedith the pound Towre
in weight 3 quarters of the ounce.’ But the Troy
pound had been used concurrently with the old mint-pound
for a long time, and there had been two standards
at the mint.</p>

<p class='c014'>According to an anonymous writer in 1507 (quoted
in Snelling’s ‘View of the Silver Coin and Coinage,’
1762) ‘it is a right great untruth and deceit that any
such pound Toweres should be occupied, for that
thereby the merchant is deceived subtilly and the mint
master is thereby profited.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>There is no doubt that after the conquest of England
by Henry Tudor a cloud of deceit came over the
coinage, deceit only ended by Elizabeth’s establishment
of the coinage on an honest basis. Comparing
the declaration of weights, measures, and coinage
by Henry III in 1266 with that of 12 Henry VII
in 1496, the latter does not show to advantage.
It orders—</p>

<p class='c015'>That every Pound contain 12 ounces of Troy
weight and every ounce contain 20 sterlings and every
Sterling be of the weight of 32 corns of wheat that grew
in the midst of the ear according to the old law of the
said land.</p>

<p class='c014'>Meanwhile the Troy ounce of silver was being
coined, not into 20, but into 40 sterlings or pennies.
But each of these was supposed to weigh 32 wheat-corns

that the English Troy pound no more came from
Troyes than the ‘pound Toweres’ came from Tours.</p>

<p class='c014'>None of these marcs seem to have any relation

<p class='c014'>There appears to have been in Northern France,
England and Scotland, about the eighth century, a
heavy 16-ounce pound of nearly 8500 grains, possibly
related, through the Russian pound, with the miná of
the Greek-Asiatic talent = 8415 grains. This was
probably the heavy pound which survived in Guernsey
up till the eighteenth century; and perhaps other
pounds said to be of 18 ounces, such as that of Cumberland
up to a generation ago, were really survivals of
this heavy northern pound. Whether this pound
dwindled spontaneously, or whether it was superseded
by the pound derived, either directly from the lesser
Arabic rotl with an ounce = 480-1/4 grains, or indirectly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>from an ounce of 10 dirhems, of about 48 grains, is
difficult to say. All that is known is that there is a
family of pounds usually known as Troy with an ounce
varying between 483 and 472 grains; that the pennies
of Charlemagne averaging 25 grains correspond to an
ounce of about 500 grains, possibly more, which is
certainly not modern French Troy, and that many
Saxon pennies of about that time were much heavier
than those of the times nearer to the Conquest. The
Northern Troy pounds show the following variations:</p>

<p class='c014'>The variation in these Troy pounds seems due to
their ounces being 10 dirhems of 48 grains, more or
less; the lightest ounce, that of French Troy, being
10 dirhems of 47·1 grains, the same as the dirhem of
which the Provençal ounce, 377 grains, contained 8.</p>

<p class='c014'>Our Troy pound, while taking its name, like the
Scots and Dutch pound, from the Troyes marc, took its
standard from some pound of full weight, possibly from
the Bremen pound, introduced by the Hanse merchants.
Its exact standard appears due to the influence
of the averdepois pound, and this would
explain—</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>
  <h4 class='c021'><i>How the Averdepois Pound was of 7000 Grains.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c020'>This division into 7000 grains was not arbitrary,
but it was due to the desire to give it as simple a ratio
as possible to the new Troy pound. It was found by
a Parliamentary Committee in 1758 to weigh 7000 of
those grains into which the Troy pound had always
been divided, necessarily into 5760 of them (12 oz. ×
20 dwt. × 24 grs.). Now it seems probable that when
the Troy pound was adopted for mint purposes its
weight might be modified, on the advice of goldsmiths
and merchants, so as to give it a convenient relation
to the old-established averdepois pound. Supposing
the new pound were of the Bremen standard, 7693
grains, of which 12 ounces = 5769·6 grains, then its
weight would be to that of averdepois as 5769·6 to
7000, or as 5760 to 6987·8. To make the proportion
5760 to 7000 it would be necessary to decrease the
weight of the Troy pound by about 8 grains or to
increase that of the averdepois pound by about
10 grains. It is probable that the latter alternative
was adopted, and that the averdepois pound was
raised in such proportion that it now weighed 7000
grains of the Troy pound = 5760 grains. This accounts
for the rise in the weight of the averdepois standard
between Plantagenet and Elizabethan times, making
the ounce = 437-1/2 grains instead of the 437 grains of
the Roman ounce.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is not improbable that the change of mint-standard
from Tower to Troy was due to the very inconvenient
ratio of the Tower pound to the averdepois
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>pound. The mint-pound being necessarily divided
into 12 ounces of 20 pennyweight of 24 parts or grains
= 5760 parts, the ratio of the Tower and averdepois
pounds was 5400 to nearly 7000, or 5760&nbsp;:&nbsp;7453, the
latter figure being about the number of Tower grains
= 0·937 grain, contained in the original averdepois
pound. The introduction of a new pound, which by
slight modification in either it or the averdepois pound
would give the simpler ratio of 5760 to 7000, would
probably be most welcome to the mercantile community.</p>

<p class='c014'>In this system, common to France, Spain, Portugal,
Florence, and Rome, the ounce is divided into 576 parts
or grains, while the Troy ounce of the rest of Europe
is of 480 grains. This makes the Latin grain
lighter.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the medicinal pound, more or less international
throughout the West, the 24 Scruples of the ounce are
grouped into 8 drachms of 3 scruples.</p>

<p class='c014'>It may be concluded that the English Troy pound
was a Northern weight with its ounce of 480 instead
of 576 parts. It has no direct connexion but in name
with the marc of Troyes. It probably came to us as
an apothecary’s and goldsmith’s pound, and in the
latter, the Latin factors 24 scruples × 20 grains were
transposed for mint purposes so as to preserve the
ancient pennyweight 1/20 ounce of the Tower pound.
But in the apothecary’s Troy pound the ounce remained
divided into 24 scruples (8 drachms of 3
scruples) each of 20 grains as in other countries except
France, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c020'>The myth of the 32 wheat-corns which formed the
basis of the Tower pound = 5400 grains, passed to the
Troy pound = 5760 grains, and this deliberate fiction
lasted till the time of Elizabeth and perhaps later.
It did little harm as regards these mint-pounds, but
its application to the Averdepois pound, alleged to be
an offshoot of the royal pound, either as 25 shillings,
that is 300 pennyweights of 32 wheat-corns, or as
15 ounces Troy, or at a later period as 16 ounces
Troy, produced a mental obliquity which is most
lamentable.</p>

<p class='c014'>The jury of merchants and goldsmiths appointed
in 1574 to examine the ancient standards, and construct
a new set, declared that ‘the one sorte of weight
nowe in use is commonlie called the troie weight and
that other sorte thereof is also commonlie called the
avoir de poiz weight, and further they say that both
the saide consiste compounded frome thauncient
Englishe penye named a sterling rounde and unclipped
which penny is limeted to waie twoo and thirtie
grains of wheate in the midest of the eare and twentie
of those pence make an oz. and twelf of those ounc
make one pound troie.’ They go on to ‘saie that the
said twoo sortes of weights doe differ in weight the
one from the other three ounces troie at the pounde
weight, for the pounde weight troie doth consiste
onlie of xii oz. troie and the lb. weight of avoir de poiz
weight dothe consiste of fiftene ounc troie.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Thomas Hylles, in his ‘Arte of Vulgar Arithmeticke’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>(1600), showed himself emancipated from the superstition
of troy weight so far as to say:</p>

<p class='c014'>‘15 ounces of Troy weight should by the statute
make 1 pound of haverdepoise, but the same pound
weyeth commonly but 14 ounces 1/2 Troy, 14 ounces
3/5 at the uttermost.’</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(14-1/2 oz. troy = 6960 grs.; 14-3/5 oz. = 7008 grs.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>But he unfortunately went on to say that ‘of
things liquid and dry 1 pound of Troy weight maketh
a pinte in measure,’ not seeing that 12 oz. troy =
only 13·16 oz. averdepois, while a wine-pint contained
16-2/3 ounces of water, and a corn-pint close on 16 ounces
of wheat or 20 of water.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the ignorance and superstition engendered by
troy weight was just as bad in 1702 as in 1600 or
even in 1500, as shown by the following utterance of
an eighteenth-century scientist:</p>

<p class='c015'>Troy weight, whereby bread, gold, silver, apothecaries’
wares etc. are weighed containing only 12 ounces in the
pound, each ounce 20 pennyweight each pennyweight 24
grams. This seems to have been the most ancient weight
by its name, as derived from the famous city of Troy,
from whence Brutus and his people are said to have
descended and to have called London Troy-Novant or
New Troy.</p>

<p class='c014'>So said J. Ralphson, F.R.S., in his ‘Mathematical
Dictionary’ (London, 1702). And then he continued:</p>

<p class='c015'>The second and more common weight is called Avoirdupois,
being fuller and larger weight than the other, for
it contains 16 ounces or 128 drams, viz. 384 scruples, viz.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>7680 grains, by this are weighed all kinds of grocery ware
and base metals, as iron, copper and brass, as also hemp,
flax, rosin, pitch, tar &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c014'>A century later we find not much improvement in
the idea of the pounds Troy and Averdepois.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The pound or 7680 grains avoirdupois equals
7000 grains troy and hence 1 grain troy equals 1·097
avoirdupois’ (Rees’ ‘Encyclopædia,’ 1819). This is
an example of the utter muddle the Troy pound had
made in the minds of otherwise intelligent people.</p>

<p class='c014'>Similar pedantic efforts were continued, well into
the nineteenth century, to represent the Troy pound
as the sole standard of England and the averdepois
pound only respectable as an offshoot of the royal
pound used for vulgar purposes.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Assize of Bread</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>Such fictions were helped by the old statutes which
compelled the sale, first by Tower and then by Troy
weight, of bread as well as of gold, silver, and medicines.
And confusion was made worse by the use for a long
period of a third weight for bread, the Amsterdam or
Scotch troy pound.</p>

<p class='c014'>The peck loaf, supposed to be that produced from a
peck of flour (16 pints), was to weigh 16 of these pounds
= 17 lbs. 6 oz. averdepois, the quartern loaf 4 =
4 lb. 5 oz., and the pint loaf (to be sold at a penny
when wheat was 4<i>s.</i> a bushel or 32<i>s.</i> a quarter) was
to weigh one pound = 17 oz. 6 drams averdepois.
The periodical Assize of Bread fixed the price of the
peck loaf.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>It appears then that the pound of bread was =
7600 grains, its ounce = 475 grains, which was about
the Scottish (and Dutch) troy standard. It was
probably adopted as coinciding with the weight of
bread supposed to be produced from a pint of flour
and as keeping up the old superstition that bread must
be sold by troy weight. As some persons in authority
did not share the stupidity of those who considered the
averdepois pound to be 16 troy ounces, the Scottish
16-ounce pound of troy standard was imported for
the purpose.</p>

<p class='c014'>This weight was abolished by 8 Anne (1710)
and the sliding scale was put in the averdepois
equivalent.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Assize of Bread was abolished in 1815, but
traces of it remain in the name ‘quartern loaf,’
although this now means a loaf of 4 imperial pounds.
It may also mean a loaf weighing the quarter of a
16-lb. stone.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Disappearance of the Troy Pound</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>In 1841 a Royal Commission on Weights and
Measures recommended the abolition of the Troy pound
as ‘wholly useless,’ retaining its ounce provisionally for
the use of bullion merchants, pending ‘the removal of
the troy scale.’ This recommendation was not carried
out until 1878, when the Troy pound disappeared,
except of course in almanacks and books for the
instruction of youth—but the Troy ounce still survives
at the mint, and consequently in the bullion market;
and it is virtually forced on druggists in spite of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Medical Council. Troy weight was abolished by the
Pharmacopœia Committee in 1864, Imperial weight
being alone recognised; yet the Board of Trade keeps
up the Apothecaries’ ounce of 480 grains. Troy
weight has fallen; but, like many other superstitions,
it dies hard.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE CUBIC FOOT AND THE TON REGISTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The cubic foot and the cubic inch are the usual
measures of solidity. The cubic yard is used as a
measure of masonry, earthwork, or reservoirs of
water.</p>

<p class='c014'>The cubic foot has many points of concordance
with weights and with measures of capacity, and is the
basis of ship and cargo measurement.</p>

<p class='c014'>The definition of the Imperial gallon as 277·274
cubic inches, the volume of 10 lb. of water at 62°, a
pound of water measuring 27·7274 cubic inches, led to
attempts to determine accurately the weight of a cubic
inch and of a cubic foot of water. These experiments
are interesting in consequence of the recognition, in
1685,<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c016'><sup>[29]</sup></a> that the cubic foot of water weighed approximately
1000 ounces, and of the probability that this
weight of water in Roman ounces, = 437 grains, was
the source of our Imperial system. It has already
been shown how difficult it is either to construct
accurately a measure containing a certain weight of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>water or conversely to determine the weight of water
in a standard measure.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c016'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The statute definition of the cubic inch of water
as = 252·458 grains at 62° corresponds to 62·326 lb.,
or 997·21 ounces, for the cubic foot. Reduction of
these weights to the standard of maximum density of
water at 39·2° increases the weight of the cubic inch by
0·29 grain, and of the cubic foot by 1·1 ounce, making
it = 62·4 lb. or 998·3 ounces. An Order in Council
of 1889 gives 252·286 grains as the weight of the cubic
inch of water. But the exact weight is uncertain, and
the 1824 statute definition seems to be as accurate
as the more recent determinations, all different.</p>

<p class='c014'>It may be taken that the cubic foot of water weighs
very approximately—</p>

<p class='c014'>And 1000 ounces of water at the original weight of
the averdepois ounce, of Roman standard = 437 grains,
would weigh 999·5 of such ounces, at 62° in air.</p>

<p class='c014'>Practically measures of capacity need only approximate
coincidence with standards; they are used for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>convenience in order to avoid weighing, especially in
retail trade. Corn and many other kinds of produce
are more conveniently measured than weighed, the
average weight being ascertained, if desired, by a
sample bushel.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fluids may also require corrections for temperature
when bought or sold by measure. Water increases in
volume 1 per 1000 between 39° and 61°; and another
1 per 1000 between 61° and 70°; other fluids have
their peculiar coefficients of expansion.</p>

<p class='c014'>Allowing then for small temperature-corrections,
the cubic foot may be taken as equal to 62-1/2 lb. or
1000 ounces of water, and at this sufficiently approximate
standard it becomes the basis of a series of
measures for ship and other purposes.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Ton Register</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The capacity of ships has for centuries been reckoned
in tons. The term arose from the custom, in French
and other wine ports, to take as the unit of cargo-bulk
the tun of wine usually contained in four hogsheads,
each of 63 wine-gallons. The number of hogsheads
divided by 4 gave the tonnage to be charged.</p>

<p class='c014'>This cargo-ton, the <i>tonneau d’encombrement</i>, was
equal to 42 French cubic feet = 51 English cubic
feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Ton Register appears to have arisen in the
ports of Northern Europe. There the unit was
usually the skippund (ship-pound) of about 360 lb.
for wool and light goods. But the Last was also a
wide-spread, though variable, measure; in the Baltic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>trade it was usually reckoned at 11-1/4 quarters of wheat
= 90 bushels or 5400 lb. In England it was usually
10 quarters = 80 bushels = 5000 lb. Now this bulk
of wheat measures about 100 cubic feet, so 100 English
cubic feet has become the unit adopted in all maritime
countries, as the Ton Register. In France it is called
the <i>tonneau de jaugage</i> and is taken as = 2·83 cubic
metres.</p>

<p class='c014'>A ship of 2000 tons register is of a capacity =
200,000 cubic feet below decks. The register tonnage
is thus obtained:</p>

<p class='c014'>Mean length × 0·94 of maximum beam × depth
from upper deck to keel, the measure being taken
inside, and in feet. The product is cubic feet, which
divided by 100 gives register tonnage.</p>

<p class='c014'>In France these measurements have to be made in
metres; the product in cubic metres is divided by
0·38 to get tonnage.</p>

<p class='c014'>Net tonnage, as distinguished from gross tonnage,
is the latter less the space occupied by cabins below
deck, by engines and bunkers, in short all that is not
‘hold.’</p>

<p class='c014'>This deduction gives the space available for cargo,
a very large proportion in a sailing-ship, a very small
proportion in a steam-yacht or tug.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Cargo Ton is usually reckoned at 40 cubic
feet; the space occupied by 20 centals = 4 quarters
of wheat, or 25 centals of water.</p>

<p class='c014'>A steamship of 4500 tons register may be 3000
tons net; as each of these net tons will contain 2-1/2 tons
of cargo of about the same weight as wheat, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>allowing for cases, dunnage, &amp;c., the ship may be
described as carrying 7500 tons dead-weight. Of
course, this would only apply to goods of medium
weight; not to iron rails or to ore, which could only be
taken as a limited part of the cargo, the rest of the
space being either filled with light goods or remaining
empty.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ship-owner has the choice of charging freight
by measurement, usually at 40 c. ft. to the ton, or
by the ton weight for metal and other heavy goods.</p>

abandoned the cubic decimetre of water as the basis of measures
either of capacity or of weight. The kilogramme is now, like our
pound, a certain metal standard, and the litre is a measure containing,
more or less exactly, a kilogramme of water. A perfect
litre standard contains 1000 grammes of water at 39·2°; but 1·1
gramme less at 62°, 2 grammes less at 70°, and 3·3 grammes less
at 80°, a very frequent summer temperature. For exact correspondence
of measure with weight, corrections are always required
whether on the imperial or on the metric system.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SCOTS, IRISH, AND WELSH MEASURES AND<br />WEIGHTS</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>Scotland</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The Scots system was distinctly North German,
influenced by English measures.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Linear Measures</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The standard of length was the Scots Ell = 37·06
English inches. Originally three Rhineland feet at
12·353 inches, it was always described as containing
37 inches. The inch, at 1/37 of the ell, was slightly
longer, by less than 2 in 1000, than the English inch.
The penalty edicted in 1685 against the use of any
other foot but that of 12 inches, while ‘three foot
and an inch’ were a Scots ell, seems to show that a
foot equal to one-third of an ell may have been used.</p>

<p class='c014'>The rod or ‘fall’ was 6 ells; the acre was 160
square rods = 1·26 acre, and very nearly equal to the
French arpent, which was equal to the Roman heredium.
This is, however, a mere coincidence. The Scots acre
comes, like the English acre, from North Germany.
The type of the Scots acre is seen in the Jück (yoke)
of Oldenburg; this field-measure is 160 square ruthen;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>each ruthe is 18 feet square, presumably 18 Rhineland
feet = 6 Scots ells, originally; though now of a
lower standard which makes the Jück = only 1·12 acre
instead of the 1·26 acre of Rhineland standard.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Weights</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>There was an ancient weight, the Tron pound, of
variable standard, about 20 Scots ounces. But its
actual weight appears to have been 9622 grains, which
is exactly 20 ounces of the original Arabic ounce =
481·18 grains. This was abolished by the Act of 1618,
which ordered ‘that the standards be kept, two
firlots by Linlithgow, the stone weight by Lanark,
the ell by Edinburgh, and the pint by Stirling, as
of old.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The Lanark stone was 16 lb. of Scots Trois weight.
An inscription on the standard still extant states that
it was equal to 15 lb. 14 oz. English Troy, that is to the
fictive long Troy pound of 7680 grains. The Scots
pound, = 7609 grains, was divided into 16 ounces =
475·5 grains, divided into 16 drops.</p>

<p class='c014'>The stone was blunderingly described (1618) as
‘the French Trois Stone containing sixteen Trois
ounces.’ But it had nothing to do with French weight
(in which the ounce = 472·12 grains); its standard
was of the Dutch Troy (Trooisch) class, coinciding
very closely with that of the Amsterdam pound =
7925 grains, the ounce = 476·5 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the 7600-grains lb. came to England as the
standard of the Assize of Bread, it was known as the
Scots or Dutch pound.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>An Act of James I (1410), ‘That a Stone be made
for weighing fifteen Trois pounds and divided into
sixteen Scots pounds,’ leads to a suspicion that there
was another Scots pound, of Rhineland standard;
for 16 pounds or double marks of Cologne are very
approximately equal to 15 long Troy pounds of English
standard.</p>

<p class='c014'>Troy oz., 480 grs. × 16/15 = 450 grs. = Tower oz.</p>

<p class='c014'>One may thus surmise that the royal pound of
Scotland, like that of England up to Tudor times, was
of Cologne or Tower standard, and was superseded
in course of time by the Amsterdam or Scots Trois
pound.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Measures of Capacity</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>In 1410 it was ordered:</p>

<p class='c015'>That the Boll be divided into 4 Firlots, and contain
29 inches within the boords, and above 27 and an half-inch
even over, and in deepness 19 inches; that the Firlot
contain in breadth even over 16 inches under and above
within the boords, and in deepness 9 inches; that the
Firlot contain 2 gallons and a pint, and the Pint to weigh,
of the water of Tay 41 ounces or 2 pounds 9 ounces; so
the Gallon weighs 20 pounds 8 ounces, the Firlot 41 pounds
and the Boll 164 pounds.</p>

<p class='c014'>This seems as clear as the water of Tay; unfortunately
the three firlots mentioned in the first half of the
quotation are three different firlots.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is also a difficulty about the pint. An Act
of James VI gives ‘the pint of Stirling two pounds
and nine ounces Trois, of clear water,’ the same weight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>as above. But another and previous Act of the same
king (1618) orders ‘that the Pint weigh three pounds
seven ounces Trois of the running water of the Water
of Leith’; and this pint is also called the Stirling
Pint, Jug or Stoup, so there were two pints, as well as
several firlots.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of the two pints, the standard of one is still extant,
which we will call the Stirling Jug or larger pint. It
contains 104·2 cubic inches = 60·1 ounces of water,
almost exactly 3 Imperial pints, and was 55 ounces
or 3 lb. 7 oz. Scots of water. It was not an aliquot
part of any of the firlots, but was itself a standard
basis of measure, of which the firlot might be 18, 19,
21-1/4, &amp;c. There is little doubt that it was one of
the ‘Kanne’ of North Germany (Du. <i>stoop</i>); these
kanne vary at the present day between 2·83 pints
in Bremen and 3·2 pints in Hamburg. There was
in Prussia until quite recently the Metze of 6 pints
or 120·8 ounces, almost exactly twice the larger
Stirling Jug.</p>

<p class='c014'>The other pint, of 41 Scots ounces = 44-1/2 English
ounces or 2-1/4 pints, was not a standard measure. It
was merely a divisional unit, one-sixteenth of the
above-described wine firlot containing 41 lb. Scots,
or 44-1/2 English pounds, of water. This firlot was
divided into 2 gallons = 20-1/2 lb. Scots, or 22-1/4 English
pounds; and the gallon into 8 pints of 41 ounces
Scots.</p>

<p class='c014'>What was the origin of this firlot, or rather of the
Boll, of which it was a fourth? There is only one
measure with which it has any affinity: the half-Cargo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of Marseilles,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c016'><sup>[31]</sup></a> divided like it, sexdecimally.

<p class='c014'>In the next reign, that of James II, about 1450,
another Firlot appeared. It was to be ‘a general
Mett, according to the Pint and Quart formerly given
to the Burgh of Stirling for an universal standard,
whereof each Firlot to contain eighteen Pints ...
and that none use another measure.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Which of the Stirling pints was the Standard?
The smaller pint of 41 Scots ounces of water, or the
Jug, the larger pint, of 55 ounces?</p>

<p class='c014'>In this case it was certainly the larger pint; for
18 pints of this standard are very nearly equal to a
firlot containing a Rhineland cubic foot of water,
1000 Troy ounces = 1886 cubic inches. Except the
slight difference between Amsterdam and Scots Troy
weight, this firlot was 62-1/2 lb. Scots, just as the English
cubic foot was 62-1/2 lb. averdepois. It was 18 pints of
104·2 cubic inches = 1875·6 cubic inches = 54 Imperial
pints or 6·76 Imperial gallons. This corresponds very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>closely to the Himt or cubic Rhineland-foot measure of
North Germany, actually = 6·85 gallons.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was a corn-firlot, and I recognise in it the
firlot mixed up with the wine-firlot and only rescued by
its stated dimensions corresponding to a capacity so
different from the calculated contents of the latter.
The dimensions given correspond to a capacity of
1809 cubic inches, a considerable divergence, but the
old custom of ordering the gauge of bushel-measures
in inches either whole or with simple fractions often
caused considerable divergence from the calculated
standard of capacity.</p>

<p class='c014'>Progress through the Acts of the Parliaments of
Scotland reveals to us more firlots, with the same
anxiety which has been seen in English statutes for
unity of standards, with the same attempts to conceal
their plurality beneath plausible wording. Under
James VI (and I of England) the Parliaments were
anxious ‘that the measure and firlot of Linlithgow
should be the only firlot for all his Majesty’s liedges.’
It was therefore ordered that the Pint of Stirling
be 2 lb. 9 oz. Trois of clear water, and the Firlot of
Linlithgow 19 pints.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has been seen that the Act of James I which
ordered the wine-firlot to be 41 lb. in 2 gallons of
20 lb. 8 oz. also stated that it was to contain 2 gallons
and a pint; thus making it in one line 16 pints (of
41 ounces), in another 17 pints. The Act of James II
ordered the firlot (presumably a corn-firlot) to be 18
pints, of 55 ounces. And then the Act of James VI
made the firlot 19 pints, of 41 ounces = 48-3/4 lb. Scots or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>53 English pounds. This capacity corresponds approximately
to the Schepel of Oldenburg, now =
50 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet another Act of James VI (1616) finds the
Linlithgow standard of the Firlot to be true and to
contain ‘twentie are pincts and ane mutchkin of just
Sterline Jug and measure,’ but, in order to put an end
to heaped measure, it orders a new firlot for malt,
barley and oats, containing 31 pints Stirling Jug, and
that the pint weigh 3 lb. 7 oz. Trois of the running
water of the Water of Leith. Thus different Acts
order firlots of 16, 17, 18, 19, 21-1/4, 31, pints;
sometimes the pint is to be 41 ounces Scots, sometimes
55 ounces, and sometimes it is not mentioned
which.</p>

<p class='c014'>The firlot of 21-1/4 pints was probably an imported
measure found to contain that number of pints;
21-1/4 × 104·2 gives 2214 cubic inches, = 7·98 Imperial
gallons, for its capacity, a measure coinciding very
closely with the Anker, which varies between 7·83
gallons in Oldenburg and 8 gallons in Lubeck (and
7·95 gallons in the Cape Colony). The Boll of 4
firlots = 4 bushels was equal to the Lubeck Ohm; and
the term Anker was used in Scotland for the potato-firlot.</p>

<p class='c014'>This firlot of 21-1/4 pints became the Edinburgh
firlot; and it happens to coincide almost exactly
with the Imperial bushel. It being fixed at 21-1/4
Stirling pints (of 104·2 c.i.) when 20-1/2 pints would have
made it 2136 c.i., almost exactly the old English bushel
(2150 c.i.), shows that it was not influenced by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>latter; it was clearly an independent measure imported
by trade. Its series was quaternary:</p>

<p class='c014'>The lippy, as its sixteenth, came to mean a sixteenth
generally. The word is a diminutive of the O.E.
‘leap,’ a basket, e.g. ‘seed-lip.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The barley and oats firlot of 31 pints = 3230
cubic inches is the real Linlithgow firlot. It was
the Edinburgh firlot increased to contain the same
weight of malt, bear (barley) and oats as that contained
of wheat.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Its capacity was 11·6 gallons, and its Boll
contained 46-1/2 gallons or 5·8 bushels. It was probably
a Boll of about this capacity the dimensions of which,
giving a capacity of about 43 gallons, were roughly
stated in the Act of 1410 as those of the wine-boll.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Chalder (of Culross) was 16 Edinburgh bolls.</p>

<p class='c014'>I need scarcely do more than mention the
smaller measures: to the Choppin (Fr. <i>chopine</i>), half
a wine-pint; to the Mutchkin (Du. <i>maatje</i>), its quarter;
to the Gill, its eighth, usually.</p>

<p class='c014'>The measures of Scotland may be thus summarised:
They appear to have all come from North Germany,
except one from Provence.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>The Ell was a length of 3 Rhineland feet, divided
into 37 inches, approximately of English standard.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Acre was a North German acker of 160 rods,
each 6 Rhineland feet square.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Pound was the Amsterdam standard of Troy =
7609 grains, multiplied and divided sexdecimally.</p>

<p class='c014'>The old wine-boll = 17·8 gallons was the half-Cargo
of Marseilles, divided into 16 pints of 41 Scots
ounces.</p>

<p class='c014'>The larger Stirling Jug was a North German
‘kanne’ of 104·2 cubic inches = 55 Scots ounces or
3 Imperial pints. It was the standard of corn-measure;
the corn-firlots were multiples of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The common corn-firlot was a Rhineland cubic
foot = 1000 Troy ounces or 18 Stirling Jugs. It was
the North German Himt.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another firlot was 19 lesser pints = 48-3/4 lb. Scots.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Edinburgh Firlot of 21-1/4 Stirling Jugs or 2214
cubic inches was the North German Anker, become
a corn-measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Firlot of 31 Stirling Jugs was a wheat-firlot
enlarged to hold about the same weight of oats.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>Ireland</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>There are in Ireland many primitive Celtic measures
worthy of study, if merely as showing the ways of
thought of the people; but apart from these, the
system of weights and measures, established for many
centuries, has been the English system introduced in
early Plantagenet times.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Some of these measures, relics of that time, long
overlaid in England, are of interest; for instance, the
gallon of 217 c.i. is one-eighth of the early wine-bushel =
1 cubic foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Irish road and field measures, multiples of the
seven-yard rod, have been noticed.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>Wales</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The general unit is the Cibyn (kibbin) = 4 gallons or
32 lb. of wheat, the English half-bushel or tuffet. It
is divided into 4 quarts, and 16 cibyns make a Peg =
8 bushels or 1 quarter.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>The Channel Islands</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>These measures are the connecting links between
those of old France, through Normandy, and those of
England, especially in land-measures. Normandy had
a system of measures kept in fair unity by the English
dukes of Normandy.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Thanks to their firm administration the English
system was generally marked by a scientific regularity
which, notwithstanding its complication, is in remarkable
contrast with the barbarous French system.’<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c016'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>For England had already, at the Norman Conquest,
a good system in which weight, wine-measure, corn-measure,
and linear measure were co-related; albeit
this co-relation, under the influence of the royal mint
pound, was forgotten for many centuries, and is indeed
scarcely known at present.</p>

<p class='c014'>But Northern France and Normandy had no such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>co-related system. Southern France had an excellent
system, indeed that of Marseilles was perfect; while
Paris, taking its measures from the South, destroyed
their co-ordination and was careless of their standards.</p>

<p class='c014'>None of the Paris series had any simple relation.
So it was in Normandy, where the systems of North
and South were mixed with Teutonic measures.</p>

<p class='c014'>The original Norman perch, like that of England,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>et est la mesure 16 pies la perque</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>probably Rhineland feet, but perches of 20, 22 and 24
Paris feet, often of reduced Paris feet, superseded it.
The Acre was always 4 Vergées or roods, nearly always
of 40 square perches, and divided into quarters.</p>

<p class='c014'>The charuée, caruée or ploughland was usually
60 Normandy acres, divided into 12 bouvées or oxgangs,
each of 5 acres or 20 vergées.</p>

<p class='c014'>Corn-measure had for principal unit the Bushel,
8 of which made a Quarter, a quarter of a horse-load
or, if large, of a cartload. The bushel was, or appeared
usually to be, a multiple of the Pot; this led to divergencies
according to the number of pots taken; yet
it seems probable that the Pot was itself a fraction,
an eighth, a tenth, a twelfth, or a sixteenth of some
bushel either wine-measure or corn-measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>While the weights and measures of Paris had established
themselves in Rouen and Caen, local measures
more in agreement with Norman customs were in
general use. Thus the Paris bushel = 793 cubic
inches was scarcely used. A typical Norman measure
was the <i>Boisseau étalon de l’abbaye de Jumièges</i>, containing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>as nearly as I could measure, 1648 cubic inches.
Now this is very approximately a cubic foot of the
reduced Paris 11-inch standard usual in Normandy,
akin to the 11-inch foot of Jersey. This cubic foot
was very nearly the Roman cubic foot or Quadrantal;
for the reduced Paris foot, = 11·72 English inches,
was very nearly the same as the quarter of the aune,
which was 4 Roman feet very approximately.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was another standard Bushel—the <i>Boisseau
étalon de la Ville de Bolbec</i>—containing, as nearly as
I could measure, 2534 cubic inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is also a peculiar measure for apples, the
<i>barattée</i> or churnful, usually of 25 pots.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Normandy as in the rest of France weights were
not related to measures. It was always known what
was the usual weight of corn in the bushel; thus the
Paris bushel was supposed to hold 20 French pounds of
wheat.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some heavy pounds, brought possibly by the
Normans, disappeared gradually before the Paris
Troy pound. Wool-weight brought from England
was used; the sack being 36 stone of 9 French pounds
or about 350 averdepois pounds.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such was the system of measures and weights used
in Normandy, and surviving there in great part. The
slightly differing systems of the Channel Islands are
simply variants of this system, a rough sketch of which
I have given by way of introduction to them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Jersey and Guernsey (the latter including Alderney
and Sark in its government) are each practically
autonomous. The Islanders keep their Norman laws,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>customs and dialects, and retain their systems of
measures, weights and currency. These are being
gradually modified by increased intercourse with
England; and French influence tries hard, especially
in Jersey, to introduce the metric system.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Linear and Land Measures</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>1. <i>Jersey.</i>—For ordinary linear measures the English
standards are used, the yard and the pied du roi;
that is the English foot. There is also an ancient ell
of 4 feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>For land measure the Jersey foot is 11 English
inches (but divided into 12 land-inches); and 24 of
these feet make a perch = 22 English feet. This
peculiar standard is evidently an adaptation of the
Norman custom (which prevailed in France) of making
24 short feet of either a quarter aune, or 11 pouces, the
perch or verge, which became officially the <i>perche
d’ordonnance</i> of 22 French feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Jersey Vergée or rood is 40 square perches
= 0·44 acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. <i>Guernsey.</i>—The linear measures are based on
the English standards. They were, in 1611:</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Measures of Capacity</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>1. <i>Jersey.</i>—The standard ordered in 1754, and
confirmed in 1771, is the Cabot, defined as containing
10 Pots.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Pot contains 123·56 cubic inches = 0·445
Imperial gallon. It does not correspond directly to
the Paris pot = 111 cubic inches or 0·41 gallon, nor
apparently to the various Normandy pots, of which
that of Caen, about Paris standard, is the type. It is
simply one-tenth of the Cabot.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Cabot, a common name in Normandy for a
corn-measure, is for wheat and for wine, cider, &amp;c. A
larger cabot, for barley and other light grain, is one-third
larger, containing 13-1/3 pots; another, for coal,
contains 14 pots. Lime and charcoal are measured
by the cask of 120 Pots, i.e. 6 bushels of 20 pots. For a
double cabot is usually called a bushel.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Cabot = 1235·6 cubic inches, and containing
4·456 gallons, coincides nearly with one-eighth of the
Paris Setier = 4·29 bushels, and also with the Panau or
Eimino, 1/8 of the Marseilles Cargo of 4·34 bushels.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is divided into 6 Sixtonniers.</p>

<p class='c014'>For wine, cider, &amp;c., it is divided into gallons
(double pots, 1/5 cabot), pots, quarts and pints.</p>

<p class='c014'>A double cabot is the bushel. The duodecimal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>division of the Paris Setier and the division (in the
corresponding wheat-water series) of the Quartant
into 9 veltes, prevent the relations of the Jersey
measures with those of Paris being clearly seen. But
the relations with the Marseilles standards, corn and
wine, from which the Paris standards were taken, are
evident. It will be seen in the <a href='#XXI'>chapter</a> on the Old
Measures of France that the Paris Setier was derived,
through the Marseilles Cargo, from the Egyptian
Rebekeh, which is the cubed cubit of Al-Mamūn.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Cabot has been stated (Ansted, ‘Channel
Islands,’ 1862) to contain 43 lb. 7 oz. of water. On
this estimate = 4·344 gallons, it is exactly the Marseilles
Eimino.</p>

<p class='c014'>N.B.—The Escandau is the Panau diminished in
wheat-water ratio. The Jersey pot is the fluid measure
in wheat-water ratio with 1/8 cabot.</p>

<p class='c014'>There seems no doubt that the cabot is the eighth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>of the setier (and of the Cargo), slightly variant, as the
Jersey pound is a variant of the Paris pound.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is also a measure for apples = 3·77 bushels
or 30 gallons. The ordinary barattée (churnful) of
apples in Normandy is 25 pots = 10 gallons.</p>

<p class='c014'>The larger Cabot for barley and other grains
except wheat was to be = 1-1/3 of the wheat cabot, that
is 13-1/3 pots; it was therefore = 5·933 gallons, very
nearly 3/4 an imperial bushel = 1647 c.i. Was it fixed
at this size to hold approximately the same weight of
barley, &amp;c., as the smaller cabot held of wheat, or was
it the Boisseau de Jumièges = 1648 c.i. approximately?
That I cannot say. But the question is of some
importance historically, for Guernsey adopted a
bushel of about this capacity, the lineage of which is
a matter of considerable interest.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. <i>Guernsey.</i>—In 1582, also in 1611, the Guernsey
bushel was ordered to be 16 inches diameter and 8 inches
deep; it was to hold 13 pots and a quart. The pot was
not defined: at the end of the seventeenth century it
is recorded to be equal to 121 cubic inches. On this
basis the bushel should be 1633 cubic inches, but
according to the dimensions ordered it contains only
1608 cubic inches. This is evidently one of the cases
where the wish to order a measure of simple dimensions
has caused the standard to deviate practically from
its calculated value. There is considerable doubt as
to the capacity of the pot, the original standard of
which is not extant. But from the definition of the
Guernsey bushel as 13-1/2 pots of approximately 121
cubic inches, it would seem that this was considered as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>roughly equivalent to the 13-1/3 pots, each 123-1/2 cubic
inches, of the Jersey barley-bushel = 1647 c.i.</p>

<p class='c014'>The bushel is divided, on its calculated capacity of
13-1/2 pots, = 1631 c.i., into</p>

</table>

<p class='c014'>The Denerel is thus, probably by mere coincidence,
exactly the old corn-gallon, and the bushel is 6 corn-gallons.</p>

<p class='c014'>The word Denerel means ‘standard’ in the sense
of the standard coin or pattern piece, the Denerial or
Deneral, to which the French moneyers had to strike
deniers or silver pence. We may confer with this
term the Marseilles Escandau, meaning ‘standard,’ a
measure = 3·54 gallons, the basis of a whole system of
measures.</p>

<p class='c014'>But if the bushel were based on another measure
than the obsolete pot—on a standard still extant in
the Sheriff’s Office, the</p>

    <div><i>Quinte, grande mesure du marché de Guernesey 1615</i>,</div>

<p class='c014'>it would be of larger capacity. For the Quinte,
I found when I measured it in 1885, is approximately
54·7 cubic inches, and it is stated to contain fully
32 ounces of water. As it happens to be equal to a
fifth of the imperial gallon, the Denerel should be
equal to an imperial gallon, and the bushel to 6 gallons.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are two other bushels:</p>

<p class='c014'>The Coal-bushel (1611) of 18-1/2 inches diameter, by
8 deep, then stated to be equal to 16-3/4 pots (an evident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>mistake, in Roman numerals, for 17-3/4 pots) and
containing an English corn-bushel.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Barley-bushel, 1625 and 1673, to contain 17-1/2
pots; of such size that it should hold, striked, as much
as the wheat-bushel held when heaped. Its calculated
capacity is 2117·5 c.i. = 7·63 gallons.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Wine-Measures</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>These have assimilated themselves in the course of
trade to those of the countries of exportation, but the
fluid measures of the islands still subsist for cider and
other liquors. The Jersey gallon is, or was, 2 pots =
247 c.i. The Guernsey gallon is, or was, 1/8 of the
bushel = 252 c.i. or perhaps 2 pots = 242 c.i.</p>

<p class='c014'>Both are somewhat over the old English wine-gallon.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Weights</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The Jersey pound, = 7561 grains, is 7 grains over
the old French pound; 104 pounds make a cwt. =
112·3 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Guernsey pound, = 7623 grains, differs by
only 2 grains from the Amsterdam pound; 100
Guernsey pounds = 108·9 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is a tradition that this pound was originally
18 ounces of Rouen weight, reduced in 1730 to
16 ounces. But it is not 16 ounces of any weight but
that of Amsterdam. It may have been originally
16 ounces of some heavy pound with an ounce of
about 530 grains, akin to the Austrian and Russian
ounce; then converted into 18 lighter ounces, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>afterwards 16 ounces were taken for the pound. In
the seventeenth century it is recorded as being 18 ounces
of 471 grains, which is approximately the Paris
standard = 472·1 grains. In 1730 it was ordered to
be of 16 ounces, but of what standard there is no
evidence. And in the nineteenth century it is 16 ounces
of 476·6 grains, almost exactly the Amsterdam
standard. It looks as if the change in 1730 was to
16 ounces of another standard, Amsterdam Troy,
instead of French Troy.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have given some space to these Channel Island
measures, so interesting as a survival of Norman
measures and as a link between the measures of old
France and of England. The peculiar monetary system
of Guernsey will be given in <a href='#XIII'>Chapter XIII</a>.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>South Africa (Cape Colony)</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>Here we find two systems, those of Holland and
of England, used according to public convenience,
and combined as far as possible. The linear standard
is Rhineland; the foot = 12·356 inches. The rod is
12 Rhineland feet; the English mile is reckoned as
426 rods.</p>

<p class='c014'>The land-unit is the Morgen = 2·12 acres, of
600 square rods.</p>

<p class='c014'>Weights are now Imperial; with a cental-cwt.,
and a ton of 20 centals or 2000 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>For corn measures, Imperial and Dutch measures
are combined in the Mud of 3 bushels or 4 Schepels.</p>

<p class='c014'>For fluid measure the unit is the Anker = 7·95
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>gallons, a lower standard than the Amsterdam anker
= 8·5 gallons, probably through the influence of
English measure. The Legger (leaguer) is 126·6
gallons, in 4 Aam, 16 Anker and 80 Velts. This gives
the Velt somewhat a lower standard than in Java,
where the legger = 127·34 gallons, and the velt =
1·59 gallons.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>India</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>Of the measures and weights of India, a country
containing one-fifth of the population of the world,
divided into many nationalities, only a slight sketch
can be given, and that chiefly of the measures used in
British India as distinguished from the tributary
states. The measures of the Aryan population of
Hindustan, and those of the Dravidian peoples of
peninsular India, are different; moreover the influence
of the Moslem conquerors, Mogul and Pathan,
of the Portuguese in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, of the English in more modern times, has
modified these measures.</p>

<p class='c014'>As in other Eastern countries the linear unit is
usually a cubit, the <i>hástha</i> or <i>háth</i>, divided into 24
digits. Traces of the Egyptian increased cubit are
to be found. In a classical work on architecture, the
Mánasára, the Hástha, of 24 digits for timber, is
increased to 25 for temples, to 26 for houses, to 27 for
municipal buildings and land. The addition of 3 digits
to the 24 of the Egyptian common cubit would give
27 digits, approximately equal to the 28 smaller
digits of the royal cubit.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>In Southern India the cubit is sometimes the
<i>mūyangál</i> (<i>mūyam</i>, cubit; <i>kál</i>, leg), the length from the
knee to the ankle.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Malabar the unit is the Kol = 28-1/4 inches as
used for timber; but for land it seems to have increased
to 30 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The kol was probably 3 spans or half-cubits of
9·41 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>A guz brought by the Moslems, = 33 inches, has
established itself in Bengal. It was probably 3 Beládi
feet of 10·944 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Portuguese Covado of 3 spans = 27·17 inches,
usually taken as 27 inches, has established itself in
Western India. It is divided into 48 digits, of which
two-thirds, i.e. 32 digits = 18 inches, are the usual
cubit; 1/8 of this = the English nail.</p>

<p class='c014'>All these measures appear to have been modified
by the English foot and inch.</p>

<p class='c014'>Native itinerary measures are rough and variable;
the Koss of 100 fathoms is the usual standard.</p>

<p class='c014'>Land-measures are of course very variable.</p>

<p class='c014'>12 guz, usually = 33 feet, make a cord or chain,
and 5 cords make a Jarib = 10 rods. A square jarib =
100 square rods, is the usual Bigha of Northern India
= O·625 acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another unit is the Mah of 100 rods 12 × 12 feet =
1600 square yards, about half the above bigha.</p>

<p class='c014'>Land-units, like most other units, can be divided
into 16 annas, so that the anna of the bigha is 200,
that of the Mah is 100, square yards.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Madras the unit of land measure is the Káni
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>(cawny) = 1-1/3 acre of 24 grounds = 6400 square yards.
So there appears to be a common unit of about 1600
square yards, with its anna or sixteenth = 100 square
yards or 10 yards square.</p>

<p class='c014'>Five káni make a Véli, the usual extent of arable
land which can be cultivated for rice or other wet
crops by a peasant with a yoke of oxen.</p>

<p class='c014'>Everywhere there are seed-measures of land, as in
other countries.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Weights</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>These are derived from a coin-weight basis, the
silver rupee-weight or Tola in most parts, the golden
pagoda-weight or Varahan in the south of India. In
each case 80 of these coin-units made a Sér. (See
Indian Coinage, in <a href='#XIII'>Chap. XIII</a>.)</p>

<p class='c014'>The Bombay sér was based on another gold coin,
the <i>tanc</i> (gold) of a little over 68 grains, 72 of which =
4900 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Bengal sér is, curiously enough, = 2 Cologne
pounds of 7200 grains. It is divided into 16 chittaks or
double ounces of 5 tolas. The tola is divided into 12
mashas (= 15 grains) of 8 ráti (the red seed of <i>Abrus
precatoria</i>): 40 sér make a mánd = 82·28 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>This sér (Ang. seer), the Government standard, is
really a Troy weight. The rupee of different standard
in the three presidencies was fixed in 1833 at 180
grains, 3 drachms of the Troy ounce; this being so,
the sér of 80 rupees weight is = 30 Troy ounces and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>the mánd of 40 sérs is = 1200 Troy ounces or 100
Troy pounds.</p>

<p class='c014'>About 1870-72 the metric propaganda was epidemic
among Indian Government Engineers; light
railways were made on metre-gauge, and a nearly
successful attempt was made to get the sér fixed at one
kilogramme. An Act was about to be passed to this
effect when the death of Lord Mayo stopped it, and
the Act fell through.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Bengal sér and mánd<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c016'><sup>[34]</sup></a> are the usual weights
for official purposes. Some other sérs are used, often of
low standard known as Kucha sérs (unripe, half-baked)
in regard to the pukka (ripe, full-measure) sér of 80
tolas.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Madras mánd was = 24·68 lb.; 20 mánd =
1 kándi, 493·7 lb.; but English trade considered the
mánd as 25 lb. and the ‘candy’ as 500 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>Madras had also a weight called the Vísham (Ang.
Viss) of 120 tolas = 5 of its sérs, or 3·086 lb. divided
into 40 pollams.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Capacity</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>To this Madras weight corresponds the Adangáli,
dangáli or puddi, or measure containing a vísham of
grain, and therefore a pound-pint measure = about 3
pints. It is the usual measure of the daily grain-wage
of agricultural labourers.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Similarly in other parts of India, the sér measure
contains a sér weight of the usual food grain.</p>

<p class='c014'>The measure is usually heaped, and whether sér
or dangáli it delivers approximately either a sér or a
vísham of the usual grains, rice, wheat, millet, pulse,
&amp;c. It is a pound-pint measure, avoiding the use of
the balance. The Madras Government wanted to fix
the dangáli at 100 cubic inches, but this would have
been useless as not delivering a vísham. The necessary
capacity to deliver a vísham of water is found by
3·086 lb. × 27·725 to be 85·76 cubic inches. Increased
in the Southern water-wheat ratio of 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;1·22, we
have 104·62 cubic inches as the true dangáli measure.
So Government allowed 104-1/4 cubic inches, and this was
about the capacity of a dangáli 8 inches high by 4
inches diameter, often a section of bamboo cut down
to the proper capacity.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Madras, the dangáli, puddi or measure is then
= 104-1/4 c.i. divided into 8 ollocks; and 8 dangáli
= 1 Mercál; 424 mercáls, = 120 Bengal mánds, made
a Garce, which is a Government measure for salt =
4·4 tons.</p>

<p class='c014'>The cubic measure used in Southern India for dry
goods, such as lime, is the Parah = 5 mercáls = 5 × 8
dangáli, or 4000 cubic inches at 100 c.i. to the dangáli:
but 4184 c.i. at the customary capacity of that measure;
so the parah is = 15 gallons.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Bombay parah = 4-1/2 gallons.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Ceylon parah = 5·6 gallons; 8 parah = 1
amómam = 5·6 bushels.</p>

<p class='c014'>To the amómam of grain corresponds the amómam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>of land, which, at 2 bushels seed to the acre, = 2·8
acres. By measurement it is 2·74 acres.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>4. <span class='sc'>Burma and the Straits</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>In Burma, as in the ancient Eastern Kingdoms,
there was a common cubit and a royal cubit. The
former, = 19-1/2 inches, was of 24 digits, in 3 taim or
handshafts; the latter = 22 inches. Here we have
repeated the two Hindu <i>hástha</i> of 24 and 27 digits; the
royal cubit being almost exactly 27/24 of the common
cubit.</p>

<p class='c014'>The basis of weight is the Tikal (shekel), = 252
grains (= 1 cubic inch of water), divided into 4 moo,
= 63 grains, and 16 gyi of 15-3/4 grains (corresponding
to the Indian masha), of 8 rati.</p>

<p class='c014'>100 tikal = 1 piet-tha = 3·6 lb., corresponding to
the Indian vísham.</p>

<p class='c014'>The principal measure of capacity is the teng or
basket, somewhat less than a bushel; it contains 16
piet of rice = 57·6 pound-pints.</p>

<p class='c014'>The tikal of Siam = 234 grains; 80 tikal = 1
catty = 2-2/3 lb.; 50 catty = 1 pikal, = 133-3/4 lb., or
about 2 bushels of rice.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Pikal (i.e. man’s load) of Singapore (and of
China) = 133-1/3 lb., is of 100 catty; the catty = 1-1/3 lb.
of 16 taels = 1-1/3 oz. The tael is of 10 mace; the mace
is a Chinese coin-weight = 58-1/3 grain, the representative
of the Greek and Asiatic drachma in the Far East.</p>

<p class='c014'>The pikal of Java = 135·63 lb., similarly divided.</p>

<p class='c014'>The hyak-kin or pikal of Japan = 132-1/2 lb. It is
also of 100 catty or kin = 1·325 lb. of 16 × 10 momme,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>the latter a weight equivalent to the mace = 58
grains; and 10 × 10 momme make another unit, the
hyaku-me = 5797 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>I refrain from doing more than giving a glance at
the weights and measures of the Far East; suffice it
to say that most of them have every appearance of
being Arabic in origin.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>5. <span class='sc'>Canada and Mauritius</span></h3>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Canada</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The Imperial system is used, but the Cental
replaces the long Cwt. and its stone divisions.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the old French districts of Quebec certain
old French measures are lawful: the Paris foot,
the perch, usually of 20 feet, the Arpent of 100 perches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Minot, of 3 boisseaux = 1·073 bushel, is still used.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Mauritius</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>This island, formerly a French colony, retained
the old French measures and weights: the Paris foot,
the Toise, the Mille of 1000 toises = 1·21 mile, the
Perch, usually of 18 feet, the Arpent of 100 perches,
the French livre, the corn-setier, the wine-setier or
Velte = 1·639 gallon.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Metric system was substituted in 1876, notwithstanding
that ‘the feeling of a great portion of
the community was so strongly against it that in
1882 it was thought to be not improbable that the
British Imperial weights and measures might be
reverted to’ (‘Merchants’ Handbook,’ by W. A. Browne,
1899). It is added that this antagonistic feeling
gradually died out, but evidence on this point would
be desirable.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>English Money</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>In all times money has been the weight of a certain
amount of copper, silver or gold, in the form of coins
the fineness of which is guaranteed by the stamp of
the State. The weight of coins used in payments may
change in course of time, but the nominal unit of
weights often continues, the pound, or livre, or marc, &amp;c.
Thus, the original Roman unit, the As, or mint-pound
of copper or bronze, reduced gradually to 1/24 of its
primitive weight, persisted as a money of account long
after it had been replaced in the currency by the silver
Denarius. This was originally coined at a time when
it represented the value of 10 As; hence its name
deni-aris, ten of copper.</p>

<p class='c014'>The French livre, or livre d’estelins, reduced
gradually to a coin about 1/74 of a 12-oz. livre, retains
its name as a synonym of the franc.</p>

<p class='c014'>The English pound of silver, once a Tower pound
= 5400 grains, reduced long ago to 1745 grains, in 20
shillings, persists as a money of account, though the
silver is superseded in payments over 40 shillings by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>a gold coin weighing 123-1/4 grains. Prices over 40<i>s.</i> are
still often stated in shillings.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Roman denarius originally weighed 60 grains,
afterwards reduced to 52-1/2 grains. A golden denarius
was also coined, which afterwards became the Arabic
dinar.</p>

<p class='c014'>Under Charlemagne the mint weight of France
was heavier than the marc of Troyes afterwards
adopted as a standard. Adapting the Roman system
to the customs of his Teutonic subjects the emperor
Karl divided the pound of silver into 20 silver solidi
or sols, each equal to 12 silver penings or pennies of
about 25 grains which, assimilated to the Roman
denarii, were called deniers, also estelins or sterlings.
The solidus appears to have corresponded to a Teutonic
monetary unit, the shilling, equal to a variable number
of penings, which coins were not of uniform value until
about Charlemagne’s time.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Carlovingian systems of coinage had passed to
England long before the Norman Conquest, displacing
the old Norse and Saxon systems—the Norse, in
which the Ore was of 20 silver penings = 1/8 marc or 1/12
lb., and the Saxon Sceatta of 40 Styca, usually equivalent
to pence. The shilling, = 1/20 pound of silver
pence, became established—‘xxx scyllinge penega,’
thirty shillings of pence (‘Saxon Chronicle,’ 775). The
Norman Conquest made no appreciable change in
the English customary coinage. The Tower pound
of silver which the Normans found established was
coined into 240 of the ‘English peny called a sterling,’
each weighing 22-1/2 grains instead of the 25 grains of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Charlemagne’s sterlings. Twelve pence made a shilling
of 20 to the pound, and twenty pence or pennyweights
made an ounce of 12 to the mint-pound.</p>

<p class='c014'>England soon followed France, but much more
slowly, in the usual dwindling of the weight of coins,
as the king, pushed for money, ordered his moneyers
to melt down the silver pennies and recoin them of
lower weight. They remained at 22-1/2 grains down to
the time of Edward I. Edward III’s first pennies
were of 22-1/4 grains, but in the 18th year of his reign
they weighed 20-1/4 grains, in the 20th year 20 grains,
and after the 27th year he made the pound of silver
yield 300 pennies at 18 grains. He also coined groats
(great sterlings or grosses). Silver halfpence (mayles)
and farthings (ferlynges) were coined, and a statute
specially ordered that no sterling halfpenny nor
farthing be molten ‘for to make vessel or any other
thing by goldsmiths nor others.’</p>

<p class='c014'>At this time, if we may believe the Statute of
Labourers, one penny was the usual daily pay of the
farm-labourer, but mowers were to have fivepence by
the acre or the day. Prices of farm-produce were
fixed. A penny would buy a chicken or six pounds of
bread, 2 pence a fowl, 4 pence a goose.</p>

<p class='c014'>The diminution in the weight of the penny was
slow and did not affect wholesale dealings in which
payment was usually made by weight.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c016'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>In all but retail transactions payment might be
agreed to be by weight. In Stephen’s reign the land-revenue
of countries was farmed out. The sheriff or
‘fermour’ of Wiltshire and Dorsetshire paid into the
treasury £454 10<i>s.</i> by weight (ad pensum) and £262 4<i>s.</i>
by tale (numero). He probably picked out the full-weight
coins for payment by tale, and had to take
(as perhaps he received) weight-value for the rest.</p>

<p class='c014'>Under Henry IV the sterling had fallen to 15 grains;
under Edward IV it fell to 12 grains, at which weight
it stood till Henry VIII brought it down to 10-1/2 grains,
and also debased it to only one-third its weight of silver.
His father had coined shillings, hitherto only a money
of account; his own mint continued this coinage, but
got 48 of them, instead of 20, from the Troy pound of
silver, and subsequently by debasement nearly 150.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Edward VI’s reign the Protector Somerset
continued this system, but, at his fall, efforts were made
by the Council to restore honesty to the coinage, at
least as regards the shillings and crowns. The pennies
remained debased until the wisdom of Elizabeth
restored the standard, and since that time our silver
coinage has remained of true standard and at the
weight of 7-1/2 grains for each penny value, or one-third
of its weight at the time of the Norman Conquest.
The Scots silver coinage fell much lower than that of
England; by the time of the Union it had fallen to 1/36,
the pound Scots being worth 20 pence English, instead
of 20 shillings.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is curious that the kings, so ready to make a
profit by lowering the silver coins, appear to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>disdained the evident profit of a copper coinage.
Penalties were repeatedly threatened by statute against
the copper coins which necessity of ‘change’ caused
to be made or imported. These were unlawful coins
called galyhalpens, saskyns, dodekyns and dotkins
(probably Scottish ‘doits’). James I granted a patent
for the making of copper farthings. Halfpennies were
first coined in Charles II’s time, but it was not till
near the end of George III’s reign that a copper
penny was struck, probably because the tradition of
the silver penny weighing 32 wheat-corns, albeit
shrunken, was against the penny being other than
silver.</p>

<p class='c014'>The penny was at first a full ounce of copper. Twopenny
pieces were also struck weighing two ounces.</p>

<p class='c014'>The present bronze coinage was made in 1860 after
the example of the bronze coinage of Napoleon III,
the reformer of the French currency; it was he who
established a gold standard in France, hitherto a
‘silver country.’</p>

<p class='c014'>A bronze penny not much worn weighs 1/3 oz., the
halfpenny 1/5 oz. The latter is one inch in diameter.
The silver penny of early Plantagenet times was the
size of the present sixpence but thinner, so that, at the
full weight of 22-1/2 grains, it was slightly heavier than
our threepenny piece = 21·8 grains. It bore the
effigy of the king with ‘Henricus Rex’ or suchlike
inscription; on the reverse was a cross, with pellets
or other ornaments in the intervals, and the name
of the moneyer and city, as ‘Edmund on Lin(coln).’
The cross gave rise to the idea that it indicated where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the penny could be broken or cut into halfpence or
farthings. Doubtless it was so cut where change was
scarce; and the first silver farthing was coined by
Edward I, 1279, to prevent this cutting up of the pence,
but equally with a cross.</p>

<p class='c014'>At present silver pence and twopences are only
coined for Maundy money.</p>

<p class='c014'>The groat of four pence, grossus sterlingus, first
coined about 1279, discontinued from the time of
Elizabeth, who first coined sixpences and threepences,
was revived in 1836 at the instance, or insistence, of
Joseph Hume, an M.P. who, it is said, found it convenient
for the exact payment of an 8<i>d.</i> London cab
fare not exceeding a mile in the days when copper
pennies weighing an ounce were inconvenient to carry
in the pocket. He died in 1855, and in 1856 the Joey
was discontinued.</p>

<p class='c014'>The threepenny piece was revived in 1845.</p>

<p class='c014'>The florin was first issued in 1849, an ill-advised
attempt at decimalising the pound; it bore the
inscription ‘one tenth of a pound,’ but it has utterly
failed to take the place of the convenient half-crown,
an important unit in the binary division of the pound.
Public convenience appreciates the gold sovereign and
half-sovereign, the silver half-crown, shilling, sixpence
and threepence. The florin is a disturbing coin offering
no advantage over two separate shillings; and the
double florin is worse.</p>

<p class='c014'>No one wants the pound decimalised except a few
decimal unpractical persons. A properly taught schoolboy
adds up sums of money duodecimally for the pence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>decimally for the shillings, converting these by twenties
into pounds. It is quite easy to add up a column of
pence thus: 8 and 5, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; and 10, 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>; and
8, 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>; and 5, 3<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> With the shillings column
the units are put down and the tens carried to the
column of tens; an odd 1 is put down and half the
remainder carried to the column of pounds.</p>

<p class='c014'>English silver coins are 37/40 = 0·925 fine, i.e. 11 oz.
2 dwt. of the now obsolete 12 oz. mint-pound.</p>

<p class='c014'>French five-franc pieces are at 0·900, other silver
coins are 0·835 fine.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Gold Coins</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>Of the two precious metals, only one can be the
standard of value. In a gold-standard country, as
England has been since 1816, the golden sovereign
of lawful weight is the standard of value. As the price
of silver, like that of every other commodity, varies
with demand and supply, it would be futile to attempt
to make silver coins correspond in actual metal value
to gold coins; especially as, since the great fall in the
price of silver from its demonetisation in many countries
and its large production, silver coins are really tokens;
tokens of value, but still tokens, not legal tender above
a certain amount. A shilling melted down is only
worth fivepence or less; while sovereigns melted down
can be exchanged, at a trifling charge, for their weight
in minted gold.</p>

<p class='c014'>In silver-standard countries it is gold which varies
in price. Thus in India, where for centuries the
standard of value has been the silver rupee now weighing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>180 grains and worth fifty years ago a little over
two shillings, gold coins of the same weight called
‘mohurs’ were current at market price, about 16
rupees more or less. Sovereigns were worth about
10 rupees in 1860; they would exchange now for
double that price did not the Government of India,
by restricting silver coinage and other legitimate
devices, keep the gold price of the rupee at about 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>,
so that 15 rupees will buy a sovereign for transactions
with England and other gold-standard countries.</p>

<p class='c014'>Gold was coined in ancient Rome. The gold
solidus or aureus of Constantine was 1/72 of an As or
mint-pound; so that it weighed 70·14 grains. It
was called ‘solidus,’ entire, as distinguished from the
semissis and tremissis, its half and third. The original
French sol, or shilling, was an ‘entire’ of 12 deniers;
hence the £ <i>s.</i> <i>d.</i> we use were once the current signs,
in France and elsewhere, for libræ, solidi, denarii.</p>

<p class='c014'>There were some gold coins of the early Saxon
kings. Under the early Norman kings foreign gold
coins were current, but the first regular gold coinage
was that of Edward III; his Noble of fine gold, 1/50 of
a Tower pound, weighed 108 grains, the weight of two
golden florins of Florence or of two ducats or zechins
of Venice. He afterwards coined nobles at the rate
of 42 to the mint-pound; these weighed 119 grains,
and, as they were of 23-7/8 carats fine, contained almost
exactly the same weight of pure gold as the modern
sovereign of 123-1/4 grains. Their value was about half
a marc or 80 sterlings of full weight, and as the proper
weight of silver in English coins was then three times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>that at present, the 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> equivalence of the noble
then is that of the sovereign now.</p>

<p class='c014'>The weight of gold coins mattered little in practice;
they were always weighed, and represented an amount
of sterling varying according to the state of the money-market
and to the condition of the silver coinage.</p>

<p class='c014'>Edward IV’s noble was called a Rial; and the
Angel, 2/3 of its weight or about 80 grains, was also
coined. Henry VII coined a double Rial of half a
Troy ounce. Under Henry VIII this was called a
Sovereign.</p>

<p class='c014'>The fineness of gold coins, originally of 23 carats
3-1/2 grains = 994·7 gold in 1000, was reduced to 22 carats
under Henry VIII and, after some variations, this
standard = 916·6 gold in 1000 was finally adopted.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c016'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Sovereigns or Unites were coined under James I
at 172 grains, under Charles I at 141 grains. Their
value in silver varied of course according to market-rates
for gold. Coined under Charles II at 130 grains
they were henceforth called Guineas, varying in value
from 30 to 20 shillings. Repeated attempts to fix
their value by law utterly failed. In the eighteenth
century it was generally above the 21<i>s.</i> standard at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>which the guinea is still reckoned as a polite coin. In
1816, on the adoption of a gold standard, the name
of Sovereign was revived for the coin which is its basis.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sovereign weighs 123·274 grains, of which
113·006 are pure gold. It is light if it weighs less than
122-1/2 grains, that is if it has lost more than 1-1/2<i>d.</i> in value.
Its life of current weight is about 20 years in ordinary
circumstances of circulation.</p>

<p class='c014'>The mint value of gold is £3 17<i>s.</i> 10-1/2<i>d.</i> an ounce
Troy; that is 2·1212 pence a grain pure, or 1·7676
penny at the standard fineness of 22 carats = 916·6
in 1000.</p>

<p class='c014'>France adopted a gold standard in 1855; other
countries followed.</p>

<p class='c014'>The United States adopted it in 1900.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sovereign is coined at full value without
‘seigniorage.’ In France and other gold-standard
countries a charge is made for coining. In France
this charge is 6 fr. 70 c. on the kilo of standard gold,
0·900 fine, value 3100 francs; this is equal to 0·216 per
cent., so that 20-franc pieces lose 4·4 centimes or
nearly a halfpenny each on being melted, besides assay
charges.</p>

<p class='c014'>The history of mint-weight will be further told in
<a href='#Carat'>Chapter XX</a>, section ‘The Carat and the Grain.’</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>Guernsey Currency</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>In this curious relic of the old French monetary
system the Livre is the equivalent of the <i>louis d’or</i>
of 24 francs; the Sol or sou is a shilling, 1/20 of the
livre; the Denier is a penny, 1/12 of the shilling, and it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>divided into 8 doubles, each equal to the old French
<i>liard</i> or quarter-sou of 3 deniers, not to the old French
double of 2 deniers. The only Guernsey coins are the
bronze pieces of 8, 4, 2, 1 doubles; that of 8 doubles
being the penny.</p>

<p class='c014'>The silver coins are French, counted 10 pence to
the franc; so that the five-franc piece passes for
4<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> Guernsey.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Guernsey pound is either a bank-note for this
amount, or 24 francs in French silver, equal to 240
Guernsey pence. Sovereigns are current, taken at
the usual rate of 25 francs and 2 pence = 252 pence
or 21 shillings Guernsey. So the English sovereign
becomes a guinea in French silver and Guernsey bronze.</p>

<p class='c014'>The people of Guernsey hold by their old system;
they find no inconvenience in it; and it is decidedly
advantageous to the English resident in the island.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>Indian Money</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The East India Company made little change in the
monetary system of the Mogul Empire. In the greater
part of India the silver rupee was the standard of value,
and the E.I.C. struck Sicca rupees (<i>sikkah</i>, coined) in
the name of Shah Alam, the Great Mogul reigning at
the end of the eighteenth century. These weighed
192 grains, but they were superseded in 1836 by the
present standard of rupee, 180 grains, of which 165
fine, bearing the English sovereign’s head. The
rupee is divided for account into 16 annas, each of
12 copper pies, though the coin so called bore until
recently the Persian inscription <i>salas pai</i>, one-third of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>a pie; the real pie, inscribed <i>ek pai</i>, one pie, being the
quarter-anna.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are silver coins of a half, quarter and eighth
of a rupee, but no anna coin. The copper or bronze
coins are half, quarter and twelfth annas.</p>

<p class='c014'>The monetary system of the Madras Presidency
(the people of which are a different race, speaking
Dravidian languages, not the Indo-European languages
of which Hindustani is the <i>lingua franca</i>) was different
from that of the rest of India. It was a gold-standard
country, the monetary unit being the ‘Varahan’ or
‘pagoda,’ a small thick gold coin of 53 grains, reckoned
as equivalent to 3-1/2 rupees or nearly 8 shillings. There
were also gold Fanams of about 6 grains, and still
smaller gold coins, used principally for largesse at
festivities.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Star-pagoda, the usual gold currency, was
of button-shape, with a star on the convex surface,
a Hindu deity on the flat. It weighed 52-1/2 grains, the
same weight as the Roman denarius, the Arabic dinar,
and the Venetian zechin, but it was only 19-1/2 carats fine.
The E.I.C. coined pagodas of lesser weight, about
46 grains, but of English standard fineness. They also
coined silver fanams, 42 being nominally equivalent
to the pagoda. These weighed 15 grains, so that they
were equivalent to 1/12 of the 180-grain rupee, to 1-1/3
anna, or to 4 copper pysa. So there was in the Madras
Presidency a double monetary series, based on the gold
pagoda and on the silver rupee, the relative value of
these coins being of course inconstant. Gradually
during the nineteenth century the gold standard was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>replaced by silver, the change taking the following
order:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. The Pagoda of 42 fanams of 8 pysa of 4 kásh.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Rupee of 12 fanams.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. Then the two-anna piece replaced the fanam,
taking its name.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Rupee of 8 fanams, of 6 pysa, of 4 kásh.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The Rupee of 16 annas, of 3 pysa, of 4 kásh.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. The Rupee of 16 annas of 4 quarter-annas
(called 3/4 pysa by the natives) or of 12 kásh improperly
called ‘pies.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The division of the rupee into 8 fanams of 24 kásh
survives, or did survive till quite recent years, in the
French settlements of Pondichery, &amp;c. The reason
alleged was that the anna is non-existent as a coin.
But it is curious that the French administration did
not discover that there was a decimal system connected
with the rupee. For in Southern India thirty years
ago, and perhaps at the present day, the pysa was = 1/3
anna and the half-pysa 1/6 anna, but these were always
reckoned among the people as 1/50 and 1/100 rupee.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c016'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
To the people of the South the rupee is divided into
5 fanams each of 10 pysa each of 3 kásh. But the
term kásh (kássu) is merely a name for the lowest
coin. The E.I.C.’s pysa of 1808 bears the Persian
inscription <i>Bis kás chhar fleūs ast</i> (It is 20 kásh, 4
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>filūs), followed by ‘XX cash.’ So this coin, so dear
to the people of Southern India that they cannot look
on the modern quarter-anna (the Anglo-Indians’
‘pice’) otherwise than as a <i>mookal</i>, a 3/4 pysa, is really
20 kásh, and the rupee is 200 filūs or 1000 kásh. Here
is a decimal division ready for the rupee, for the half-pysa,
nominally 1/96 rupee (in 1797 coins it is so inscribed
‘96 to one rupee’), but 1/100 rupee in the bazaar, is
similarly inscribed as of ‘10 kásh 2 filūs.’ So the
rupee could easily be made of 10 fanams, 100 lesser
pysa, 1000 kásh. But the sexdecimal division into
annas, and the duodecimal division into pies, are too
convenient to be given up for a decimal system.</p>

<p class='c014'>The 2 filūs of the half-pysa show that the pysa
was once divided into 4 of a small coin (the present
pie), the <i>fils</i>, an Arabic word probably representing the
L. follis.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c016'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Indian Gold Coinage</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>Northern and Central India, the parts more immediately
under the Mogul empire, were silver-standard
countries. The silver rupee (sicca, = 192 grains) was
the standard; and the golden rupee of the same weight,
called an Ashráfi, or gold mohur, was valued at 16
rupees, though generally more, according to the
market-value of gold. The E.I.C. continued to strike
gold mohurs, with halves, thirds and quarters. Other
gold coins were current, notably the Venetian zechin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>and the approximate correspondence of this coin to
the quarter-mohur caused the latter to be commonly
known as a ‘chick.’<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c016'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Southern India offers the curious instance of a gold-standard
country (a century ago) having changed to
a silver standard. The pagoda has disappeared in
currency. The beautiful Farūki pagoda of Tippoo
is still to be found; and the Venetian zechin with its
archaic design, never changed since it was first struck
in the thirteenth century, is highly esteemed in the
household treasuries of affluent Indians for its great
purity. The word zechin or sequin is derived from
sikkah, ‘coin.’ The usual Persian inscription on the
Mogul coinage, continued by the E.I.C., is <i>Shah Alam,
bádshah gházi, sikkah mubárak</i> (Shah Alam, king
victorious, coin auspicious).<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c016'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c019'>4. <span class='sc'>Decimal Currency</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>It is scarcely necessary to describe the decimal
systems of which the Dollar currency is the type.
They have some advantages in numeration with the
counterbalancing defects of all decimal series. Division
of the dollar stops at a quarter; then there is a drop
to 10 cents, and that coin has no quarter. Any
thirding can only be approximate.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r36'>36</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>‘Twenty-four carat’ was taken as the standard of pure gold

assay-grains. Medieval gold coins such as Edward III’s noble
and the Venetian zechin, always of the same quaint pattern,
were generally twenty-three carat 3-1/2 grains fine, = 995 parts in
1000. But this nearly pure gold being very soft, it became
customary to alloy the metal with a certain amount of copper
to give it the hardness necessary for trade purposes in modern
times.</p>

<p class='c009'>The primitive divisions of time were the day (the
civil day between two sunrises or sunsets), and the
lunar month taken as 30 days instead of the actual
29-1/2. Twelve lunar months made a calendar year of
360 days, to which were added, in ancient Egypt, five
intercalary days. The additional day required every
fourth year was called by the Romans <i>bissextum
calendis</i>, as it was introduced by repeating the sixth
day of the calends of March (our February 24).</p>

<p class='c014'>From the 360 calendar days of the year was
derived the division of the sun’s apparent path on
the ecliptic (and of every other circle) into 360
degrees. The ecliptic was divided, like the year,
into twelve equal parts named from the constellations
to which they corresponded; each of these was
of 30 parts.</p>

<p class='c014'>To avoid the intercalary days at the end of the
ordinary year, these were afterwards distributed among
the months in various ways. The number of days to
each modern month is inherited, with some changes,
from the arrangement adopted by a Greek-Asiatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>nation. The names of the months are those given by
the Romans; their year originally began with March
(as indeed did ours, on Lady Day, down to 1751), and
the original names were:</p>

<p class='c014'>The week is of astrological origin. Even in Europe
there are still many people who believe that the seven
planets of the pre-Copernican system rule, each in its
turn, the successive hours of each day; the planet
ruling the first hour gives its name to the day, and
influences it astrologically. Thus the week is the
series of seven days ruled successively in the first hour
by one of the seven planets. From the series of
planets arranged in the order of their periods—Saturn,
Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon—the
order of the day-names comes about in the following
way:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Sunday (<i>dies Solis</i>) was so named from the Sun
ruling its first hour. The following six hours being
ruled by the other planets, the Sun again rules the
eighth hour, also the fifteenth and the twenty-second;
the twenty-third hour is ruled by the next planet in the
series, Venus;<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c016'><sup>[42]</sup></a> the twenty-fourth by Mercury, and
the first hour of the next day by the Moon, hence this
will be Monday (<i>dies Lunæ</i>). The Moon ruling the
first, eighth, fifteenth, twenty-second hours of Monday,
the twenty-third hour will be ruled by Saturn (beginning
the series again), the twenty-fourth by Jupiter,
and the first hour of the next day by Mars; hence this
day will be <i>dies Martis</i> or Tuesday, from the planet
Tiw = Mars. And so on with the remaining days,
the names of the planet ruling the next day being
obtained by passing over the name of the two planets
ruling the twenty-third and twenty-fourth hours.
Thus beginning with the first planet of the series
we get:</p>

<p class='c014'>The unit of time is the mean solar-day, the time
between the noons of two successive days, noon being
taken as the moment of the passage of the sun over
the local meridian, corrected by the equation of time
or daily correction required to reduce the varying solar
days to a mean of all the solar days. So ‘mean time’
is that of a well-regulated clock dividing the year into
mean solar-days of 24 hours; there being 365 days,
5 hours, 48 minutes, 46 seconds, in the astronomical
year.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is probable that everywhere, in primitive times,
both day and night would be divided, in southern
countries at least, or at the equinoxes, into three
watches of fairly equal length: the morning, midday,
afternoon; and the evening, midnight and dawn.
Each of these would become divided, with the rise
of astronomical observations and the use of sun-dials,
into fourths, making twelve hours for either day or
night; twelve hours corresponding to the twelve
months of the year or to the uncial divisions of other
measures. The civil day would thus be of twenty-four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>hours, grouped into watches of four hours or into
the eight canonical divisions of the day. In medieval
times midday was properly the hour of sexte, the
sixth hour from prime, the third from tierce; but in
course of time the ninth hour, nones, was shifted from
3 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> to midday, which thus became ‘noon.’</p>

<p class='c014'>But the original division of the day, probably
Chaldæan, was strictly sexagesimal. It was divided
into 60 parts (= 24 minutes), each part into 60, and
this again into 60.</p>

<p class='c014'>In medieval times the Sun’s daily path was divided
into 24 hours, each of 15 degrees; and each hour was
also divided into 3 miles or mileways of 5 degrees
(= 20 minutes). This division was connected with
the popular concrete idea of time in which 20 to 24
minutes was the common unit. In India the popular
unit is still the time required to boil a pot of rice (20 to
24 minutes) or do some similar domestic task. In
the Middle Ages the Western unit was the time required
to walk a mile, on medieval roads.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘And thogh I stonde there a myle’ (Gower, 1390).</p>

<p class='c014'>‘And maketh every minute seem a myle’ (Spenser,
1594).</p>

<p class='c014'>Then the degree was divided sexagesimally into 60
minutes each of 60 seconds, as at present. These
divisions were at first called scruples, from the above-mentioned
division of the day into 60 scruples of 24
minutes (the ounce being divided into scruples each of 24
light grains). Here the scruple-sense of 1/24 passes to 1/60.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘1610. The latitude fiftie degrees and fortie scruples
or minutes’ (Quot. <i>N.E.D.</i>).</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>The hour was also divided similarly into 60 scruples
or minutes, each of 60 second scruples or seconds.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ounce and scruple division of time is shown
in the following passage from ‘Le Breviari d’Amor,’
a thirteenth-century poem by Ermengaud, a monk
of Beziers. I have freely translated it from the
Languedocian. ‘The day is divided into quarters,
each of 6 hours; and the fourth part of an hour is a
point, the tenth part of which is a moment; the
moment is divided into 12 parts called ounces, and each
of the ounces yields 47 atoms, which time called an
atom cannot be further divided.’ It seems almost
certain that ‘atomus xlvij’ is either a mistake for
xlviij or deliberately put for <i>set</i> (7), to rime with <i>ret</i>
(yields). The ounce of time, = 7-1/2 seconds, would be
divided into 24 scruples and 48 oboli, called atoms
as being the end of the division. Similar dropping
of a unit from Roman numerals is to be found in
medieval Acts of Parliament and Ordinances.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Lunar Year</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>In the lunar year used by Moslems and Jews, and
also recognised by law in the movable date of Easter
and some other feasts, the month is approximately
of 29-1/2 days, so that the year is 354 days, less than the
solar year by 11 days, or 12 in leap years. Hence Moslem
feasts or fasts, such as the Ramadán and the times of
pilgrimage, are that number of days earlier each year.</p>

<p class='c014'>The age of the Moon is found by the Epact, its
age on the first day of the year. It is about the same
on March 1 as on January 1, owing to January and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>February being together equal to two lunar months.
So the increase of the Epact during the year, at the
rate of about one day in the month, begins March 1;
and September is, for this purpose, the seventh month.</p>

<p class='c014'>To the day of the month add the Epact and the
number of the month, beginning March 1. The total,
over 0 or over 30, is the age of the moon.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Example.</i>—September 10, 1910 (7th Month), Epact
for 1910 being xix.</p>

<p class='c014'>10 + 19 + 7 = 36. The Moon was 6 days old.</p>

<p class='c014'>What will be the date of full moon, its fifteenth day,
in November 1912? November is the ninth month
and the Epact for 1912 is xi.</p>

<p class='c014'>11 + 9 = 20. 45 (= 30 + 15) - 20 = 25. <i>Ans.</i>
November 17.</p>

<p class='c014'>Agriculturists who believe that certain seeds should
be sown, trees planted, and pigs converted into bacon
during the waxing of the moon, while trees are felled
during the waning, find the Epact useful in reckoning
the moon’s age. It is also useful in calculating whether
country-roads will be moonlit during certain nights.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Epact increases 11 days annually: 1911, 0;
1912, xi; 1913, xxij; coming back to 0 in 31 years.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Compass Card</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>While the circle of the horizon is divided into 360
degrees for astronomy and for accurate navigation,
the steersman has always divided it sexdecimally.
The temple of the Winds at Athens was octagonal;
and the points of the horizon were named after the
eight winds, a number increased to sixteen about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>time of Ptolemy. The Romans tried in vain to substitute
an uncial division; their 12 winds and points
could not supersede the 8 winds and points of the
Greeks. And to this day in the Mediterranean there
are 8 principal points, named after the sun and winds:</p>

<p class='c014'>Tramontano, Levant, Mezzodi, Ponente.</p>

<p class='c014'>Greco, N.E.; Scirocco, S.E.; Libeccio, S.W.;
Maestralo, N.W.</p>

<p class='c014'>Amerigo Vespucci sailed for the ‘<i>Ponente una quarta
di Libeccio</i>,’ West, one point S.W.; and afterwards for
the ‘<i>Libeccio una quarta del Mezzodi</i>,’ S.W. one point S.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>Measures of Heat</span></h3>

<h4 class='c045'><i>Thermometric Scales</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>About 1595 Galileo made a thermometer, probably
one with an air-bulb in which expansion of the air
forces water down the tube.</p>

<p class='c014'>Isaac Newton made an oil-thermometer with a scale
of 12° between freezing-point and body-heat.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fahrenheit, about 1714, made a mercurial thermometer,
its 0 at the cold produced by a refrigerating
mixture and 24° at body-heat. On this scale, freezing-point
was 8° and boiling-point 53°. The quarter-degrees
were then made whole degrees, producing the
Fahrenheit scale with 32° for freezing-point, 96° (more
correctly 98·4°) for body-heat, and 212° for boiling-point
at ordinary atmospheric pressure. There are
180° between freezing and boiling points.</p>

<p class='c014'>Réaumur’s scale has 80° between these points.</p>

<p class='c014'>Celsius (of Upsala, 1742) used a scale of 100°
between these points. Hence it is usually called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Centigrade. This is the scale of international physical
and chemical reports; and is generally used in laboratory-work.</p>

<p class='c014'>The maximum density of water is at 4° Centigrade
= 39·2° F.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Fahrenheit scale is generally used in English-speaking
countries. It is convenient for meteorological
purposes as there is rarely any need to use ‘minus’
degrees for winter temperatures as in the Centigrade
and Réaumur scales. For medical purposes it is
also more convenient to have the normal body-temperature
at 98·4° F. (close to 100°), than at 36·9° C.
or at 29·5° R.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c016'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>To convert Centigrade degrees into Fahrenheit:</p>

<p class='c014'>Double the degrees; deduct 1/10; add 32°.</p>

<p class='c014'>E.g., 20° C.; 20 × 2 = 40; 40 - 4 = 36; 36 +
32 = 68° F.</p>

<p class='c014'>To convert Fahrenheit degrees into Centigrade:</p>

<p class='c014'>Deduct 32°; halve the degrees; add 1/9 (roughly
1/10 or a little more).</p>

<p class='c014'>E.g., 100° F.; - 32 = 68; 1/2 68 = 34; 34 + 3·4 =
37·4 (37·75 correct).</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>Measures of Density</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>Specific gravity and the density of fluids at
different temperatures were known in very ancient
times. The ‘Eureka’ experiments of Archimedes
are well known. Al-Khazini (1121)<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c016'><sup>[44]</sup></a> determined the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>specific gravity of metals and of fluids at different
temperatures as accurately as modern physicists
have done.</p>

<p class='c014'>The hydrometer, divided into 24 qiráts, was well
known in the East, even before the time of the Caliphates.</p>

<p class='c014'>The density or specific gravity of solids and fluids
is usually referred to that of distilled water at 62° F.
= 16·6° C.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is sometimes referred to 4° C. = 39·2° F. There
is no advantage in this temperature, that of water
at its maximum density; corrections for temperature
will always have to be made in exact determinations,
while, in the approximate determinations of trade,
the indoor standard of 62° F. requires no correction.</p>

<p class='c014'>The specific gravity of gases being in the ratio of
their molecular weight, which is referred to that of
hydrogen, this gas is taken as the standard.</p>

<p class='c014'>The density of solutions of salts, sugar, acids, &amp;c.,
is referred to that of water or stated on a trade-scale
usually indicating the percentage in solution.</p>

<p class='c014'>The density of spirits is referred to that of water,
but their alcoholic strength to:</p>

<p class='c014'>(<i>a</i>) A scale indicating the volume of alcohol per cent.
(Gay-Lussac and Tralles).</p>

<p class='c014'>(<i>b</i>) An arbitrary scale (Cartier and Baumé).</p>

<p class='c014'>(<i>c</i>) An excise-scale on the basis of proof-spirit
(Sykes).</p>

<p class='c014'>Proof-spirit meant originally a spirit sufficiently
strong to take light, and which, if poured on gunpowder
and lighted, would cause the powder to explode. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>was the ‘Holland-proof,’ By a statute of 1816 it
was defined as of specific gravity 12/13 that of water at
51° F., which is = 0·923; but at the present standard
temperature of 60° = 15·5° C. it is 0·920.</p>

<p class='c014'>With Sykes’s hydrometer, used in England:</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Under Proof</i> (U.P.)—each degree means 1 per
cent. of water, the rest being proof spirit.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over Proof</i> (O.P.)—each degree means 1 per cent. of
water required to be added to bring the spirit down to
proof.</p>

<p class='c014'>The scale of Tralles’s alcoholometer only differs
from Gay-Lussac’s by water being taken at 39·2°
and pure alcohol as of sp. gr. 7939 at 60°.</p>

  <h2 id='XVI' class='c004'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE ELLS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Ells are the Cubits of the modern West. They
are of two kinds: the Foot-Ells, of which the Persian
cubit and the Beládi cubit, divisible into 2 feet, were
the types, and the Span-Ells, of 3, 4, 5 or 6 spans.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>The Foot-Ells</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>In France the Aune was 4 Roman feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the Italian states the Braccio was usually
2 local feet, but sometimes an Eastern cubit.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the German and Norse states the Eln was 2 local
feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Spain the Covado, of 2 Burgos feet, was the
Beládi cubit.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>The Span-Ells</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The Span-Ells of Western Europe are of two types,
derived either from the English foot, or from a Netherlands
foot which has disappeared and which was
probably the Olympic foot. (See Holland, in the <a href='#XVII'>next chapter</a>.)</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The Netherlands Ell appears then to be 3 spans of
an Olympic cubit = 3 × 18·24/2, which is equivalent
to 2-1/4 Olympic feet: 2-1/4 × 12·16: both = 27·36
inches. The Antwerp Ell was formerly = 27·396
inches, and that of Amsterdam = 27·216 inches.
There has been shrinkage, probably through the influence
of the English standard of the Flemish Ell, we
having taken 3 of our own spans, = 27 inches, for this
largely used trade-measure, and our standard having
prevailed in foreign trade. So the Flemish Ell has
tended more and more to the English standard. In
Holland and its colonies it is = 27·08 inches. This is
also the standard in Portugal. The lesser <i>pík</i> or <i>drá</i>
of Constantinople, = 27 inches, was probably = 26·8
inches as in Egypt; it may have increased under the
influence of the English or Flemish Ell. The Venetian
braccio, = 26·9 inches, probably comes from this
Turkish <i>pík</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Northern France there was an Aune = 27·1
inches and another of 27 Amsterdam inches = 27·36
inches (the Amsterdam foot being of 11 inches).</p>

<p class='c014'>In Prussia there is, or was, an Ell = 26·257 inches.
It was described as of 2-1/8 Rhineland feet; but it was
almost certainly 3 Roman spans = 2-1/4 Roman feet
(11·67 × 2-1/4 = 26·257 inches), brought into the Rhineland
system by representing it as 2-1/8 Rhineland feet,
which it is only approximately; 2-1/8 × 12·3563 being =
26·2617 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nowhere out of England and Scotland is there
found any Span-ell other than of 3 spans. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>apparent exceptions are in Spain, where the Vara of
3 feet, = 1-1/2 Beládi cubit, is a 4-span ell, like our Yard,
and in Occitania (Southern France), where the Cano
is an 8-span fathom.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Ell,’ formerly Elne, meant at first the natural
cubit or length of the forearm (L. <i>ulna</i>) from the finger
tips to the bend of the arm or ‘el-bow.’ Originally of
2 spans, it came to mean a greater multiple of the span,
or, as in the case of the German ells and the French

<p class='c014'>The Flemish Ell was that of the Netherlands,
brought to the standard of our inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Long English Ell or cloth-goad of 6 spans was a
double Flemish ell. It has long been extinct.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Yard has survived, from its convenience as
either of 4 spans or of 3 feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Scots Ell = 37·058 inches corresponded to the
English yard; it was 3 feet Scots, i.e. of Rhineland
standard, = 12·353 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Common English Ell, the tailor’s yard, ‘taylors
yerde, virga cissoris,’ was probably the French aune
= 46·6 inches, introduced under the Plantagenets
from their French dominions and cut down to fit our
ell system. This ell appears to have been carried
abroad by trade. Both the 3-span Covado and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>5-span Vara of Portugal are identical with our ells,
their spans being longer than the ordinary Portuguese
spans and called <i>palmos avantejados</i>, long spans.</p>

<p class='c014'>The four-foot Ell of Jersey and Guernsey was
probably the French ell increased from 4 Roman feet
to 4 English feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of the foot-ells of Italy and Germany, several were
exactly half our ell, while quite foreign to the native
standards.</p>

<p class='c014'>Both our Ell and our Yard were divided into 4
quarters and 16 nails. The Elizabethan standards,
still extant, are so divided.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of the English span-ells the Yard alone remains.
The 5-span Ell, maintained by the statute authority
which prescribed the breadth of cloth, lived only as a
royal measure and, like the royal pound, was gradually
superseded by the more popular measure. The ell
was obsolete nearly a century before the royal pound
silently disappeared. It seems, however, to have
survived in Wales for a long time.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Only a sketch of these can be given, for in some
countries so various are the local standards that each
petty state, each district sometimes, would require
a long study.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>I. <span class='sc'>The Teutonic Countries</span></h3>

<h4 class='c045'><i>Sweden</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The Roman foot = 11·67 inches. This is, or was,
also used in Oldenburg and in some parts of Holland.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Denmark and Norway</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The Rhineland foot = 12·356 inches, divided into
12 Tomme (thumbs), 12 feet = 1 rode (rod).</p>

<p class='c014'><i>North Germany</i></p>

<p class='c014'>The principal types are:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. The Rhineland foot, in Prussia, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. The Hanoverian foot = 11·5 inches more or
less, used in Hanover, Pomerania, part of Holland and
Belgium, Bavaria, Mecklenburg, and Geneva.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The Hanseatic foot, 11·32 inches more or less,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>used in Lubeck, Bremen (11·39), Hamburg (11·276),
Dantzig, also in Hesse, Saxe-Coburg, and Poland.</p>

<p class='c014'>The length of 11·32 inches points to the probability
of the Hanseatic foot being a reduced Rhineland foot,
11/12 of 12·356 inches = 11·3264 inches. There are
several instances of the popular objection to a long foot
and of the artifice which reduces it to a more convenient
length by taking 11 inches of the government standard,
and making from them a foot of 12 short inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. The Amsterdam foot = 11·146 inches, also used
in the Dutch parts of New England. This foot is
divided into 11 inches, an evident instance of a reduced
foot, unconcealed by any division into 12 new inches.
The practice of making a reduced foot stands revealed,
and is confirmed by the Amsterdam rod (roede) being
13 of these reduced feet, evidently to make up in land-measure
for the reduction in the foot in the home and
in the workshop. This compensation is of the same
kind as that now used in English agricultural weights
where, to compensate for the statute reduction of the
ancient 16 lb. stone, of which 16 made a wey or load
of 256 lb., the custom arose of taking 18 statute-stones
of 14 lb. to make a load of 252 lb. approximately
the same as the old load.</p>

<p class='c014'>The question now arises: What was the foot of
12·16 inches which the Hollanders reduced to
11/12 = 11·146 inches? Was it the Olympic foot?</p>

<p class='c014'>The seafaring Netherlander, to whom the nautical
mile and its 1/1000 part = the Olympic fathom, were
familiar, would very possibly take its sixth part as
their foot, just as the seafaring Greeks had taken it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>But landfolk accustomed to the short Roman foot,
which is still to be found in the land-measures of
Holland, would reduce the longer foot to 11 inches for
popular use.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet the longer foot has left traces in the Netherlands.
The Amsterdam roede of 13 Amsterdam
feet is = 12·07 feet, i.e. 12 feet of 12·07 inches. The
Amsterdam Ell, = 27·08 inches at present (= 3 spans
of 9·023 inches), was, in 1647, according to John
Greaves, = 27·216 inches, giving a foot of 12·1 inches,
and he gives the Antwerp Ell as = 27·396 inches,
which gives an Antwerp foot 12·176 inches, a length
very close to that of the Olympic foot of 12·16 inches.
There appears to have been a slight shrinkage in the
Amsterdam ell.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Austria</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>There are two standards of foot. While the
ordinary foot, 1/6 of the Klafter or fathom, is = 12·441
inches, that of the ell (which is 2-1/2 feet) = 12·245 inches.
It looks as if the one were increased, and the other
equally decreased, from the Rhineland foot, = 12·356
inches.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>The Latin Countries</span></h3>

<h4 class='c045'><i>Italy</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>Here every state, almost every city, had a different
standard of length. The foot was generally of Roman
type = 11·67 inches, or of a very short type, =
about 10·3 inches, referable possibly to half an Egyptian
royal cubit, = 20·64 inches, a measure still extant in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Egypt. There was usually also a braccio or cloth-ell
of 23 to 26 inches, probably of Eastern origin.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Lombardy the standard was the Luitprandi
foot (pié Aliprandi) = 20·28 inches, with a corresponding
pertica or rod of 12 <i>piedi</i>, usually = 20·23 feet.
Legend refers this measure to the foot-length of a
giant Lombard king; but it is evidently a cubit,
probably a variant of the Egyptian royal cubit, for
2/3 of it gave the Lombard foot, = 13·52 inches; and
this, as also the Venetian foot, = 13·69 inches, seems
referable to the Egyptian royal foot, = 13·76 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>But everywhere and always the people object to
a long foot-standard. Whether in ancient Egypt or
in modern Italy, they will take a more convenient
length; they will halve the cubit so as to get a short
foot, or take some span, or some ell divisible into
spans. So in Italy there was generally a local foot
and also a span. Sometimes the span was 3/4 of the
foot, at other times it was a fraction of a braccio or
ell; and both foot and span might be called a <i>palmo</i>.
This term was equivalent to the L. <i>palmus major</i> as
distinguished from the ordinary <i>palmus</i> of 4 digits.
In Rome there is, or was till recently, a series the same
as that of ancient Rome, on the basis of a foot = 11·72
inches, slightly longer than the ancient foot = 11·67
inches; 5 feet made a <i>passo</i>, and 1000 <i>passi</i> a mile.</p>

<p class='c014'>The foot was of 16 digits, usually called <i>oncie</i>,
inches, and 12 of these digits were taken for a palmo
= 8·79 inches. Three of these palmi made the braccio,
the cloth-ell, = 26·38 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Roman field-measures were a mixture of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>decimal chain-units and of lengths derived from seed-measures
of land.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Tuscany the standard was the braccio, = 22·98
inches, half of which was the palmo, = 11·49 inches.
The braccio was divided, as if it were a money-pound,
into 20 soldi, of 12 denari.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the kingdom of Naples, with its population of
Greek origin, the standard of length was the meridian
mile, divided into 1000 Olympic fathoms or passi.
But the passo was divided, not into six long feet, but,
like the Egyptian royal cubit, into 7 palmi, = 10·4
inches. The usual standard was the Canna of 8 palmi,
a reversion to the common Mediterranean measure
of the reed of 8 spans.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Genoa there was, and perhaps is still, a palmo
= 9·764 inches, a length exactly that of the pán in
several cities of Provence. It has changed but little
since the time of Recorde’s ‘Pawn of Geans’ (1543)
or since John Greaves (1647) gave it as = 9·78 inches.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c016'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Genoa, the language of which district is a dialect
of Provençal, has measures of the Provençal type.
The measures of Provence will be described at length
in <a href='#XXI'>Chap. XXI</a>.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Spain</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The standard is the Burgos foot = 11·127 inches,
3 feet making a Vara. This foot was originally =
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>10·944 inches,<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c016'><sup>[46]</sup></a> i.e. half the Beládi cubit, brought by
the Moors. This original standard has been preserved
very nearly in the two-foot <i>Covado di ribera</i>, the shore-cubit,
= 21·9157 inches, its half = 10·9578 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>That the Burgos foot has deviated, like most
Spanish weights and measures, from the accurate
standards of the Moors, is shown by the length of
the Spanish <i>Legua maritima</i>, the league of 3 meridian
miles, or 6653·36 varas. At the modern standard of
the Burgos foot this is</p>

<p class='c014'>6653·36 × 3 × 11·127 inches = 220,958 inches,
while 3 meridian miles are</p>

<p class='c014'>2026·66 yards × 3 × 12 inches = 218,880 inches,
showing an error of 2078 inches = 57·7 yards.</p>

<p class='c014'>Taking the original standard of the Burgos foot at
10·944 inches,</p>

<p class='c014'>6653 varas × 3 × 10,944 = 218,880 inches,</p>

<p class='c014'>exactly corresponding to the Parasang, = 10,000 Beládi
cubits of 21·888 inches, or to 20,000 Burgos feet as
instituted by the Moors.</p>

<p class='c014'>The erroneous standard of the Burgos foot appears
to have been corrected. The tables of A. de Malarce,
approved by the French government in 1879, give the
Burgos foot as = O·27833 metre = 10·938 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>That Spain also once had the Roman foot is shown by
the survival in Tunis of the Drá Andalussi, the Spanish
Ell, of 3 Roman spans of 8·753 inches = 26·25 inches.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>
  <h4 class='c021'><i>Portugal</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Here the Roman standard is seen in the Palmo or
span = 8·749 inches, 3/4 of a foot = 11·665 inches.
The palmo is divided into 8 <i>polegadas</i>, inches, of 12
lines, or into 12 <i>dedo</i>, digits, of 8 lines.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Vara, = 43·7 inches, is of 5 spans; the Braça,
or fathom, is 2 varas or 10 spans; 3000 fathoms
make a league, = 3·89 miles, divided into 3 <i>milhas</i> of
8 <i>estados</i>, stadia or furlongs. In land-measure 4840
square varas make a <i>geira</i> (= 1·47 acre) exactly, as
4840 square yards make our acre. One may infer
that the form and division of the geira was similar to
that of our acre; that it is, or was, 220 × 22 varas,
a 1/10 strip of some ‘acreme’ measure. This view is
supported by the use in Brazil of a land-unit, the
<i>quadro</i>, officially 150 × 1 metres; a strip of an
original square quadro corresponding to the 10-geira
field. In Argentina the <i>cuadra</i> is 150 varas, and the
<i>cuadra cuadrada</i>, 4·17 acres, is that measure squared.</p>

<p class='c014'>Portugal has another span, the <i>palmo avantejado</i> =
9·0256 inches, of which 3 make a covado or cubit =
27·078 inches, virtually the Flemish ell of English
standard.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>Russia and the East</span></h3>

<h4 class='c045'><i>Russia</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The standard of length is the English foot, introduced
by Peter the Great. There is another and older
measure, the Arshīn = 28 inches, i.e. the Turkish
arshīn of 27·9 inches varied to a simple relation with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>new foot; and like the Turkish measure it is divided
into 16 nails (Verstok). See ‘Arshīn,’ further on.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>4. <span class='sc'>The Hashími Cubit</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>After the Moslem conquest of the countries of the
Eastern great monarchies, the 25·26 inch standard of
the Persian cubit was raised to 25·56 inches. This
is the Hashími, or Hashemic cubit, named after Hashim,
the chief of the Arab tribe to which the prophet
Mahomed belonged. It is the cubit mentioned in the
‘Arabian Nights’ (524th night). But the cubit or
the foot of the Nights, when not specified, is usually
either of the Olympic or of Al-Mamūn’s standard.
The increase of the Persian cubit was probably to bring
it, together with the Beládi cubit and the Arshīn (to
be described presently), into simple relation with a
Qasáb of length slightly increased so that this should,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>for building and land measurement, be a common
multiple of the three cubits. This is the Turkish qasáb,
the qasáb qabáni = 153·45 inches.</p>

<p class='c020'>The date of this measure is as uncertain as its source.
It is a Turkish measure = 27·9 inches or thereabouts,
divided into 16 qirát. This division points to it being
2/3 of a Persian guz of 24 qirát.</p>

<p class='c014'>Among the guz of Persia there is one = 1-2/3
Hashími cubits = 42 inches, of which 16/24 = 28 inches.
If this length were taken, it might have been somewhat
lessened to make it an aliquot part of the Turkish
reed or qasáb, 6 Hashími cubits = 153·36 inches. At
the length of 27·9 inches, 5-1/2 arshīn = 153·45 inches
or within 1/10 inch of the qasáb.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>It is curious that the Reed should be 5-1/2 arshīns, as
our Rod is 5-1/2 yards.</p>

<p class='c014'>While the Turkish qasáb is—</p>

<p class='c014'>7 Beládi cubits, 6 Hashími cubits = 5-1/2 arshīns,
the Egyptian qasáb, somewhat less, is—</p>

<p class='c014'>6 Assyrian cubits of 25·26 inches = 151·56 inches,
or 5-1/2 double royal feet of 13·76 = 151·36 inches, and
is divided into 10 ‘belendi’ feet of 15·156 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is a lesser Egyptian qasáb of 5 arshīns
= 139·65 inches and a third still less, of 4 Assyrian
cubits = 101 inches. With each of these qasáb
20 × 20 make a Feddan of land.</p>

<p class='c014'>The word Pík is the Greek pichūs, a cubit.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Note of Acknowledgment</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>In this and the next two chapters I have necessarily
had to work largely on materials gathered by others.
The equivalents of foreign measures and weights are in
many cases taken from—</p>

<p class='c014'>Kelly’s ‘Cambist,’ 1816.</p>

<p class='c014'>Woolhouse’s ‘Measures, Weights and Moneys of all
Nations,’ 1890.</p>

<p class='c014'>De Malarce, ‘Poids et Mesures,’ 1879.</p>

<p class='c014'>Browne’s ‘Merchants’ Handbook,’ 1899.</p>

<p class='c014'>The information in the last of these is excellently
compiled and very trustworthy.</p>

<p class='c014'>My object is to give, not tabulated series of measures
but their history and rationale, to apprehend the ways
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>of thought which have given rise to them, to seek their
relations. No country has an isolated system, or
even an isolated measure, and unity underlies the
infinite variety of measures and weights.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>Teutonic Systems of Weight</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The German and Norse pounds are of three types:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. The pound of the Cologne mark, the double
marc, = 7216 grains, its ounce = 451 grains. This was
the standard of the old Tower weight of the English
mints. It coincides with the Arabic lesser rotl, 1/100 of
the Cantar of Al-Mamūn (= 102·92 lb.).</p>

<p class='c014'>Its modern type is, or was, the pound of Prussia
and Hanover = 7218 grains, 1/100 of the Centner
= 103·11 lb. It was defined as 1/66 of the weight of a
Rhineland cubic foot of water (see <a href='#XIX'>next chapter</a>).</p>

<p class='c014'>2. The Troy pound, of variable standard, from
7705 grains (ounce = 481·5 grs.) in Denmark, and as
high as 483 grains in Sweden, to 7595 grains (ounce
= 474·7 grs.) in Holland. Even in Holland there is
another standard, that of the Amsterdam pound,
7625 grains (ounce = 476·7 grs.), the medium standard
of Troy weight, = 10 Egyptian dirhems of 47·6 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The Nuremburg pound = 7390 grains, its
ounce = 462 grains. As the 12-oz. pound of apothecaries’
weight, it is = 5522 grains, its ounce = 460·2
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>grains. This pound is derived from the 8-ounce <i>peso
di marco</i> of Venice = 3695 grains. The Venice ounce,
= 460·2 grains, was divided into 144 carats of 3·19609
grains. This ounce was 8 centesimal drachmæ of the
Arabic lesser rotl = 5763 grains, when divided on
the Greek system into 100 drachmæ of 57·63 grains,
instead of on the uncial system, so that 8 × 57·63
= 461·04 grains. This is the apparent basis of the
Venetian marc-ounce and the Nuremburg ounce.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the Marc was 2/3 of the classic 12-oz. pound, the
word came to mean 2/3 of a pound, either weight or
coin; it probably came from ‘San Marco’ of Venice.</p>

<p class='c014'>German and Scandinavian ounces were usually
divided into 2 loths or half-ounces, 8 quentchen and
16 Pfenning.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Holland the mint-ounce was of 20 Engels, each of
32 Azen. ‘Engel’ is the English sterling or dwt.;
the Aas is an ace, a light grain = 0·7417 grain.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>The Baltic Skippund.</i> This ship-pound was 20
lispund, of either 20 light or 16 heavy pounds:</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>East-European Systems of Weight</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The Pounds of Poland, of Russia, of Austro-Hungary
and Bavaria (also a mint-pound in Sweden),
appear to have developed from the Arabic pounds on a
dirhem-basis.</p>

<p class='c014'>1. The Polish pound, 16 × 8 dirhems of 48·9
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>grains, = 6258 grs. It is divided into 16 ounces;
the oz. = 391 grs. (Cf. the lb. of Sardinia and of
Languedoc; the oz. = 392 grs.)</p>

<p class='c014'>2. The Russian pound or fūnt, of 12 ounces.
The ounce (lana) = 526·6 grains is almost exactly
10 greater dirhems of 52·6 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>This ounce is exactly that of the rottolo attári or
Assyrian rotl of 8426 grains (the Greek-Asiatic miná)
still extant in Bássora (Chaldæa) and in Algeria. The
relationship is evident, since the Roman As was 1/100 of
the Greek-Asiatic talent, and the greater dirhem was
1/9 of the As-ounce = 420·75 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The Austro-Hungarian pound, also used in
Bavaria, is 16 × 8 dirhems of 50·6 grains = 6482·3 grs.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. The Swedish mint-pound.</p>

<p class='c014'>This pound, = 6503 grains, was divided into
2 mint-marcs, divided again into 8 ounces of 406·3
grains. Of the same type is the commercial skaalpund
= 6536 grs.; its oz. = 408·5 grs., a weight
exactly the same as that of the ounce of Genoa, which
belongs to the dirhem-system, being 8 dirhems of
51 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Swedish medicinal weight is Nuremburg.
There are two miner’s pounds showing the extremes
of Troy weight; the ounces being 483 and 471 grains.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>The Mediterranean Systems of Weight</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>In Egypt the dirhem-system gives rise to two series
of weights: that of the Oka and that of the Rottolo.
In the latter word the Arabic ‘rotl’ is Italianised,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the Arabic weights having come under Roman influence;
an influence of long standing, since Al-Mamūn divided
the Cantar after the Roman plan into 125 lesser rotl
as well as into 100 greater rotl, when the Arabic gold
Mithkal, 1/72 of the Egypto-Roman libra, took the
place of the exagium solidi or aureus, 1/72 of the Roman
mint-As.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Mithkal, or Miskal, = 72·74 grains, was divided
into 24 Egyptian qirát = 3·03 grains, as the Aureus
had been divided into 24 Roman Siliquæ = 2·92
grains, and 16 of the 24 qirát was the standard of the
silver dirhem = 48·5 grains, <i>the lesser dirhem</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>The golden Dinar, 21-3/4 qirát, was of the weight of
the Attic commercial drachma = 65·6 grains; it
displaced the Roman golden denarius. But the lesser
dirhem, 2/3 the weight of the Mithkal, did not succeed
in displacing an old-established drachma, which
became a greater dirhem. For, as the Mithkal had a
dirhem 2/3 of its weight, so the Roman Aureus, 1/6 of the
As-ounce, had a silver drachma 3/4 of its weight. The
As, originally 1/100 of the Greek-Asiatic talent, had its
ounce divided, after the Greek system, into 8 drachmæ
each 5049/(12 × 8) = 52·6 grains. Apparently this <i>greater
dirhem</i> tended, in Arab times, to fall towards the
standard of the lesser dirhem = 48·5 grains. This is
the probable explanation of the variations of the
dirhems, and of the pounds based on them, along the
Mediterranean coasts.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Tunis the dirhem = 48·58, almost exactly the
original weight of the lesser dirhem. But in Tripoli
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>there are two standards, 47·075 and 50·1 grains. The
Ukyé or ounce is goldsmith’s weight, 10 dirhems of
47·075 grains; but in commercial weight it is in dirhems
of 50·1 grains, so it is made the same weight by reckoning
it as 150 kharūb or qirát instead of 160 of these as
in the goldsmith’s ounce of 10 dirhems of 16 qirát.</p>

<p class='c014'>So there are variations in the weight of the dirhem
basis of the Mediterranean pounds:</p>

<p class='c014'>The qirát, 1/16 of the dirhem, varies with it.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Egypt</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The Oka, = 2·723 lb., is 400 dirhems of 47·66 grs.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Rottolo, = 98 lb., is 144 dirhems of 47·66 grs.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Oka is a centesimal multiple of the dirhem.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Rottolo is an uncial multiple of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>100 Rottoli = 1 Cantar = 98 lb.; this is the modern
Egyptian Cwt. which has succeeded the Cantar of Al-Mamūn
= 102·92 lb.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Turkey</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>There is a double series as in Egypt, but the Turkish
series are based, one on the Dirhem and the other on
the Egypto-Roman ounce at the standard of 436·45
grains. In modern Rome it is 436·26 grains, in
Tuscany 436·66 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>The Dirhem, = 49·5 grains, is 16 qirát of 3·1 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Cheké is of 100 dirhems = 4950 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Oka is of 400 dirhems = 2·83 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Cantar is = 2000 ounces = 124·7 or 44 Oke.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Cantar is divided into 100 Rottoli of 1·247 lb., =
20 ounces.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Libbra and the Rottolo</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>Rottoli of over 16 ounces are not uncommon in
Mediterranean countries, whether Moslem or Christian.
They form an alternate series with the libbra series.
Thus in Algiers there are 3 rottoli of 16, 18 and 24 oz.,
each ounce, = 526·6 grains, being 10 greater dirhems,
and coinciding with the Russian ounce. There are—</p>

<p class='c024'>in Sicily a 12-oz. libbra, = 4897 grs., and a 30-oz.
rottolo = 12,244 grs.;</p>

<p class='c024'>in Malta a 12-oz. libbra, = 4886 grs., and a 30-oz.
rottolo = 12,215 grs.;</p>

<p class='c024'>in Genoa a 12-oz. libbra, = 4893 grs., and an 18-oz.
rottolo = 7378 grs.;</p>

<p class='c024'>in Naples a 12-oz. libbra, = 4950 grs., and a rottolo =
13,750 grs.</p>

<p class='c014'>These Italian libbre belong to the dirhem system,
their ounces being 8 dirhems of slightly different
weights; and the ounces are of much lower weight
than the ounces of the northern countries or of ancient
Rome. Though divided into 12 ounces, these libbre
belong to the same class as the 16-oz. pounds of Southern
France; all having ounces of 8 dirhems. But in
North Africa the Oka and the rottolo have an ounce
of 10 dirhems.</p>

found in every pound used in Europe and the countries

Morocco, Majorca, Sardinia, Gascony, is then an
Arabic weight, with an ounce of 8 dirhems, of 49

<p class='c014'>The pound of Provence was 16 ounces, each 8
dirhems of 47·1 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Troy pounds had ounces of 10 dirhems varying
between 47·2 grains for French Troy and 48·3 for
northern Troy.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Spanish pound = 7101 grains, its ounce =
443·8 grains, was originally at the Moorish standard of
6 mithkals to the ounce, that is the Egypto-Roman
ounce, the old averdepois ounce. But 6 mithkals
being equal to 9 lesser dirhems, this dirhem-basis
appears to have been taken. Then, for lesser
dirhems of 48·5 grains, 9 heavier dirhems of 49·3
grains, nearly the Morocco and Gascony standard,
were substituted.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Nuremburg or Venetian pound. Its ounce, =
460 grains, was 12 drachms of 57·6 grains, 1/100 of the
lesser rotl.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Cologne pound of 7200 grains, its ounce =
451 grains, or at Tower standard 450 grains, was the
greater rotl. Or its ounce was 9 dirhems of that rotl,
dirhems of 50·03 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is thus seen that every European pound is

<p class='c020'>Measures of capacity are always either—</p>

<p class='c014'>(<i>a</i>) based on a certain cubed linear measure;</p>

<p class='c014'>(<i>b</i>) made to hold a certain weight of water or of corn.</p>

<p class='c014'>In England they were originally based on the

cubit.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Germany, amid a great diversity of measures, a
chaos to anyone who has not the key to the principle
of unity underlying variety, apparently aberrant
measures often show by their names that, while their
value has changed, they were originally of a standard
that can be traced. And it will generally be found
that they are related to a cubic foot, perhaps increased
in water-wheat ratio. Sometimes there is one measure
for wine and corn, and sometimes the increased corn-measure

<p class='c014'>(<i>a</i>) In Holland there seems to be no measure of
capacity corresponding to the cubic foot, but this,
increased in w.w. ratio, gives the Schepel = 6·12
gallons, the Skipple of New England.</p>

<p class='c014'>(<i>b</i>) In Hamburg the cubic-foot measure is also absent,
but the w.w. increased measure appears as the Eimer
= 6·375 gallons, now used for wine, and this measure,
again increased, appears as the Anker = 7·97 gallons,
both being now fluid measures.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Bremen and Lubeck, the Eimer = 6·4 gallons,
and the Anker = 8 gallons, the one of 4 and the other
of 5 viertels, are both wine-measures; while the corn-measure,
the Scheffel, = 7·6 gallons, is very nearly
the old English corn-bushel.</p>

<p class='c014'>(<i>c</i>) Prussia and Hanover both had the Rhineland
foot, but Prussia, while recognising the cubic foot of
water as 66 lb. weight, Cologne standard, had no
corresponding measure of capacity. In Hanover and
in Brunswick the Rhineland cubic foot of water, =
6·78 gallons, was represented, not by a wine-measure,
but by a corn-measure, the Himt = 6·852 gallons.
And the increased measure, 6·85 × 1·25 = 8·56
gallons, which should properly have been the corn-bushel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>appears in Hanover as the Anker, a second wine-measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>And yet a wine-measure corresponding to the Rhineland
cubic foot did exist, in the Viertel = 1·713
gallons, exactly one-fourth of the capacity of the Himt.
Five viertels make an Anker, which shows that the
Himt, presumably at first a wine-measure of 4 viertels
or quarters, was increased in water-wheat ratio to the
Anker of 5 viertels. But their original positions were
reversed: the Himt became a corn-measure and the
Anker a wine-measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>The original wine-measure of 4 viertels, now the
Himt corn-measure (represented in Scotland by the
Firlot), is important in this story.</p>

<p class='c014'>The existence of the Himt supports my hypothesis of
the origin of the Rhineland foot. The side of a Himt
of quadrantal, or exactly cubical, shape measures
12·385 inches, not 3/100 of an inch above the 12·356
inches of the Rhineland standard foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Himt is then the Troy talent of 1000 ounces, 2/3
of the Arabic kantar, which was 1500 Troy ounces, in
just the same way that the English wine-bushel = a
cubic foot, the measure of 1000 old averdepois ounces
of water, was 2/3 of the Alexandrian talent of 1500
Egypto-Roman ounces.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Himt being the Troy talent-measure, 2/3 of the
Arabic cubic foot, it should have to the Arabic cubic
cubit a proportion 2/3 of the normal proportion 1/3·375
of any cubic foot to its cubic cubit. So the Himt =
6·852 gallons × 3/2 × 3·375 = 34·688 gallons, almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>exactly the Arabic cubic cubit, which became the Cargo
of Marseilles, or the Setier of Paris. Now this standard
of 34·73 gallons or thereabouts is not uncommon in
Germany. In Hanover and Hesse-Cassel the Ohm =
34·26 gallons is a wine-measure, in Saxony the Malter =
34·7 gallons is a corn-measure, divided into 12 scheffels.
Corresponding to this in England was an ancient
measure, the Amber (Hamberboune, Hamberbarrel).
In other parts of Germany where the cubic foot is
smaller, being derived, as in Hamburg, from a foot
= 11·24 inches (or at least corresponding to this foot),
the cubic foot there gives a measure = 5·12 gallons,
and when increased in w.w. ratio = 6·4 gallons. This
latter measure × 5 gives 32 gallons, and this number
of gallons, either as an Ohm, wine-measure, or × 8 =
32 bushels as a Malter, or corn-measure, is common
throughout Germany. There seems in many places
to have been a double standard, the smaller derived
from a cubic foot, and the larger derived from the
Arabic cubic cubit and somewhat cut down to become a
multiple of the smaller measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Viertel, = 1·713 gallons, the quarter of the
Himt, is also an important measure, not only as giving
the clue to the Troy talent, but also as a very widespread
wine-measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>It passed to France, there becoming the Velte =
1·62 gallons at Bordeaux, 1·76 gallons at Paris, where
its introduction into the series of wine-measures broke
the regular division of the Muid. At Bordeaux this
velte was probably the cause of the English wine-gallon
increasing from its original 216 cubic inches (1/8 of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>cubic foot, or wine-bushel of 1000 ounces) to 231 cubic
inches. At the latter capacity it became just half
of the Bordeaux velte.</p>

<p class='c014'>The shrinkage of the Bordeaux velte to 1·62
gallons may have been the effect of adaptation to an
English double wine-gallon, or it may have been from
the velte, when passing to Holland, having to adapt
itself to the other wine-measures of that country. The
Dutch Velt or Welt took a place between the Stoop,
= 0·5337 gallons, and the Steekan, of 8 stoopen; and it
thus became a measure of 3 stoopen = 1·601 gallon.</p>

<p class='c014'>It gave rise to the Legger, of 80 velts. This
passed to English trade as the Leaguer, but failed to
establish itself, being soon only known as a long cask of
about 150 wine-gallons used for the lower tier of water-casks
in ships. Above the ‘leaguers’ came the
‘riders.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The Velt and the Leggar are still used in colonies
now or formerly Dutch. The Leggar in Java = 127·34
gallons.</p>

<p class='c020'>The Moslem conquest of the greater part of the
Mediterranean countries, with the influence of Arab
trade and of Moorish civilisation, displaced the Roman
system of weights and measures, already modified by
the influence of Ptolemaïc Egypt, and caused changes
even in the weights and measures of Italy. Not only
the North of Africa, but Spain, Provence (and the
other Occitanian lands), the dominions of the three
republics of Venice, Genoa and Arles, with the countries
forming the Turkish Empire, all these took more or
less the Arab system of weights and measures, and
this system penetrated deep into Western Europe.</p>

<p class='c014'>The principal Arab measures which form the basis
of the Mediterranean measures of capacity were:</p>

feet (the Persian foot being half the cubit of 25·26

<h4 class='c021'><i>Turkey</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The weights and measures of capacity seem a
maze of confusion, until the clue is found. There is a
double series of weights based on the dirhem and on
the ounce. This ounce is not mentioned in the series of
weights, but once discovered, it gives the clue to the
maze, and the system is then seen to be really simple.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>It has already been seen that the weights are in a
double series giving the Oka of 400 dirhems, and the
Cantar of 2000 Egypto-Roman ounces, = 124·7 lb.,
divided into 100 rottoli. The weight of the dirhem,
= 49·5 grains in the cheké goldsmith’s weight, becomes
= 49·6 in the Oka, 1/44 of the Cantar.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Fluid-measure.</i>—A double cantar, 2 × 124·7 lb.
= 249·4 lb., was increased in water-wheat ratio, 249·4
× 1·25 = 311·75 lb. = 31·175 gallons. The actual
capacity of this water-Cantar is 31·412 gallons.
This measure is divided into 100 rottoli-measure
(= 3·14 lb. of water), each of 2-1/2 rottoli weight = 50
ounces.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Corn-measure.</i>—The Cantar measure becomes, for
corn, the Fortin, at a standard of 31·1 gallons. This
measure being 2 × 1·25 = 2-1/2 times the Cantar weight
of 2000 ounces, contains 5000 ounces of water or 4000
ounces of wheat. It is divided into 4 Killows of
7·775 gallons. This measure is evidently named from
the Greek <i>chilioi</i> (Fr. kilo) as holding 1000 ounces
of wheat. It is divided again into 4 Saa.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Fortin is also divided into 88 rottoli, the
rottolo containing 500 dirhems of water or 400 dirhems
of corn.</p>

<p class='c014'>In fluid-measure there is an oka-measure; 8 oka,
= 3-2/3 rottoli-measure, make an Almud = 1·15 gallon. I
only mention this intrusive measure to confer it with
the Spanish Almuda or Celemin = 1·01 gallon.</p>

<p class='c014'>These Turkish measures, fluid and corn, afford
another instance of the practice of increasing a fluid
measure in water-wheat ratio, and then of using this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>increased measure for fluids as well as corn. Instances
of this practice have been seen in German measures
(for instance the Himt). And our own gallon affords
a somewhat similar instance. Increased from the
cubic foot to make a corn-gallon, this was again
increased by 3 per cent. to make the Imperial gallon,
both for fluids and for corn.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Italy</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The system of measures left from ancient Rome,
themselves of Oriental origin, has been to a great
extent overlaid by Arabic measures.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Bologne the Corba, = 17·3 gallons, is half the
cubed Black cubit, to which the Neapolitan oil-Salma,
= 35·5 gallons, is closely approximate.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Rome the principal corn-measure, the Rubbio
= 64·77 gallons, bears an Arabic name; it is doubled
in the Tuscan Moggio, and investigation would probably
discover a measure of 4 rubbii = 259 gallons
= 32-1/3 bushels or about the old English chaldron of
4 quarters.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Starello of Sardinia, = 10·8 gallons, is approximately
a quarter of the Ardeb.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>Hebrew Weights and Measures of Capacity</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The Hebrews used the measures of Egypt and
Phœnicia. The common Egyptian cubit, very near
‘the cubit of a man,’ was the usual measure of length.
They brought back from the Captivity some Persian
measures:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>1. The Great Assyrian cubit, which is ‘the cubit
and an hand-breadth.’</p>

<p class='c014'>2. A measuring Reed of six cubits long, by the
cubit and an hand-breadth = the modern qasáb of
Egypt.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The Cubit of the Talmud = 21·914 inches, the
1/3000 of the Bereh, which was 1/1000 of an hour on the
equator (see page 27).</p>

<p class='c014'>For weights they used the Alexandrian talent or
Kikkar divided in the Phœnician manner into 50 minás
of 60 shekels = 218-1/2 grains. This shekel was sometimes
called the Shekel of the Sanctuary and was then
divided, not into 8 Gerahs of 27·31 grains (our dram,
1/16 of the Egypto-Roman ounce) but into 2 Bekah or
4 Reba or 20 Gerah = 10·9 grains. The Reba, 1/4 Shekel,
was the drachma of the Phœnician weights, = 54·62
grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>When, as recorded in Exodus xxvii, 603,550 men
contribute each a Bekah or half-shekel of silver, the
amount of 301,775 shekels is stated to be = 100
talents and 1775 shekels, after the shekel of the Sanctuary.
In this statement the talent is of 3000 shekels,
according to the Phœnician reckoning.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Ezekiel xlvi, the shekel is given as of 20 gerahs
and the miná is stated to be 20 + 25 + 15 = 60
shekels, confirming the Phœnician mode of dividing the
Alexandrian talent as that used by the Hebrews, viz.
50 minás of 60 shekels.</p>

<p class='c014'>The measures of capacity had for principal unit the
Olympic talent, the weight of water of the common
Egyptian foot cubed, = 6·48 gallons. It was called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>the Bath for fluid measure, the Epha for corn and other
dry measure. The Bath was divided into 6 Hin =
1·08 gallon (this being about the same capacity as the
Spanish and Turkish almuda) and into 72 Log, = 2/3
pint. The Epha was likewise of 72 log, and 4 log made
a Cab.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Cor or Homer was a measure of 10 Epha or
Bath, = 64·8 gallons or 8·1 bushels. It coincided
approximately with 2 great Artaba, this measure being
the cubed Royal cubit = 31·695 gallons; × 2 = 63·39
gallons.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Hebrew field-units were at first seed-measures,
afterwards fixed geometrically.</p>

<p class='c014'>The unit was the Bathsea, sown with a Bath of
grain; it was 8 qasáb, or 48 great cubits, square, = a
rood.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Betheoron, sown with a Cor, 10 Bath, of grain,
was 10 of the lesser unit and therefore = 2-1/2 acres.</p>

<p class='c014'>In these three chapters on foreign measures and
weights I have tried to show the principles of unity
underlying the variety of measures. To describe
them fully would require a series of monographs which,
however interesting, would lack the more important
general view. I shall therefore confine myself to the
full description, in Chapters <a href='#XXI'>XXI</a> and <a href='#XXII'>XXII</a>, of the
measures and weights of France which, both in the
old system and in the metric system, are of special
interest to us. Before proceeding to these I must
treat, in a somewhat discursive chapter, of the meanings
of some names of measures.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>General Remarks</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>In the various names of weights and measures there
are many general-utility words which offer no difficulty
in the sphere of those who use them habitually,
yet which are sometimes puzzling to others, while
they are interesting to the student of semantics.
They form a chapter in the history of weights and
measures, itself a volume in the history of the human
mind.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some terms have an obvious meaning, as ‘half’
and ‘quarter.’</p>

<p class='c014'>These inevitably run through the usual series of
measures. Even the metric system has to tolerate
half-units as a concession to unscientific weakness
while refusing quarters otherwise than as 25 hundredths
of the unit. But quarters are firmly rooted in the
human mind and resist scientific attempt to extirpate
them. They are very common in the sexdecimal
series, representing a fourth of one unit and four of a
lower unit.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Quart and Quartern have acquired certain definite
senses, the first of a quarter-gallon, the second either
of a quarter-pint or of a quarter-peck. Quarter by itself
is of wide application; it may mean the fourth of a
pound or of a hundredweight or of a dollar, or of an
acre. In its Teutonic form we have it in farthing
and in firkin. France has its <i>quart</i> as a quarter-pound,
its <i>quartié</i> in land-measure, its <i>quarteron</i> as a quarter-hundred,
though usually 26.</p>

<p class='c014'>The context, whether in writing or in speech, usually
shows the meaning of ‘quarter’ unless that meaning
has been destroyed by legislation, as in the case of the
Quarter of wheat where the meaning of the word could
not be recognised either by the eminent scientific
member of a Parliamentary Committee or by the
scientific expert in measures giving evidence before
him. The Quarter has remained, while the Chaldron,
of which it was a fourth, was so worried by legislative
interference that it disappeared as a corn-measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>The French Setier in its different senses of a load
of corn, of a bushel, of a double gallon, and of a pint,
had long lost all connection with L. <i>sextuarius</i>; it
had indeed got to mean a quarter in the same way
that in Italy the <i>sestiero</i>, originally one of the six
districts of a city, had acquired a similar sense to the
French <i>quartier</i> as a district. The French setier or
sestié had so lost its original meaning as to be often
written ‘septier,’ as if it were a seventh.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Greek obolos (originally meaning a copper nail),
1/6 of a drachm, acquired in Latin the sense of ‘half.’
When the drachma took the weight-sense of 60 grains,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>an obolus was 10 grains; but this was half a scruple,
so it took a general sense of ‘half,’ and the halfpenny
was latinised as an obolus.</p>

<p class='c014'>Maille was the corresponding French word for halfpenny,
being It. <i>medaglio</i>, Prov. <i>medaio</i>, akin not only
to ‘medal’ but also to ‘metal,’ in which there seems
to be a sense of ‘half’ of an alloy. Yet it became a
weight of 1/4 ounce, perhaps from being half of the loth
or half-ounce. And the Fr. <i>felin</i>, It. <i>ferlino</i>, probably
corruptions of vierling or farthing, on becoming 1/4 of
the <i>maille</i>, was 1/16 of the ounce. In the section on terms
used in old land-measures I have shown the equivocal
sense of words related to ‘ferling.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Our Yard, from the influence of its French equivalents—<i>verge</i>,
rod, and <i>vergée</i>, rood—became a quarter-acre,
and then a quarter-hide.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Drachm as a part of the Troy ounce, 1/8, became
the dram as a part of the averdepois ounce, 1/16. As a
measure it became 1/8 of a spirit pint.</p>

<p class='c014'>The terms signifying 1/12, 1/16, 1/24 and some smaller
fractions of weights or measures, show a development
of meaning which will be given in the following
sections.</p>

<p class='c020'>The yard is lawfully divided (as was also the ell) into
4 quarters and 16 nails.</p>

<p class='c014'>The hundredweight is divided into 4 quarters, 8

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>How did ‘Nail’ come to mean a sixteenth of a
unit, length or weight?</p>

<p class='c014'>The ‘New English Dictionary’ throws no light on
the origin of this peculiarly English term. The only
other general name I know for a sixteenth is the
Indian ‘anna,’ the sixteenth of a rupee, of a crop, of a
venture, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c014'>The story of the Nail reaches back to the early
history of weights and measures and is of philological
as well as metrological interest. The half-cubit or
span, the common handy measure in most parts of the
world, is of 12 digits, while the foot is 16 digits and
is still so divided in Italy and other southern countries.
The digit is not only a middle-finger breadth, it is also
a thumb-nail breadth; as the former it was in Greek
<i>dactylos</i>, as the latter <i>onyx</i>, which became <i>onkia</i> in
Southern Italy and gave rise to two Latin words, <i>unguis</i>
for the actual finger-nail, <i>uncia</i> for the thumb-nail
breadth equal to the digit and generally for a twelfth
part. Hence a differentiation of meaning in the
Romance languages.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the Romans adopted the duodecimal or
‘uncial’ system they applied it to the foot, which was
divided into either 12 or 16 parts both called unciæ;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>but to distinguish these they used two other words,
<i>digitus</i> for the sixteenth and <i>pollex</i>, thumb, for the
twelfth, the thumb-breadth.</p>

<p class='c014'>In English ‘unce, ynch’ always meant the thumb-breadth
1/12 of a foot, ‘Nail,’ the thumb-nail breadth
equal to the digit, being kept for the 1/16 foot. Thence
‘nail’ came to have the general sense of sixteenth
and to be applied to that fraction of a 4-span yard,
of a 5-span ell, of a bushel, of a hundredweight.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Latin the analogous general sense of twelfth
belonged to <i>uncia</i>, whether of the foot, of the land-unit,
of the pound. The general sense of twenty-fourth
attached to the scruple as 1/24 ounce, passed to
the qirát, or carat, in the countries influenced by Arab
customs, as being 1/24 of the mithkal, the Arab successor
of the Roman solidus.</p>

<p class='c014'>In modern Italy the palmo or span, and the libbra
or pound, were both divided into 12 <i>oncie</i>, meaning
inches or ounces.</p>

<p class='c014'>With the general substitution of the 16-ounce
pound for that of 12 ounces, the word ‘ounce’ lost its
meaning of twelfth. In some of the Romance languages
its sense of length extended to the length of any finger-joint,
especially to the length of the proximal joint
of the thumb. Thus in Southern France the <i>ounço dóu
pouce</i> (Fr. <i>once de poulce</i>) was taken as 1/5 of the span
or nearly 2 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>When our Cwt. was raised to 112 lb. and the 16-lb.
stone replaced by that of 14 lb. the term Nail was
applied to the half of the new stone, and it was perhaps
the divisibility of the new Cwt. into 16 parts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>7 lb. that reconciled people to the unpopular new
weight. But for all that, the people held on for
centuries to the 16-lb. stone, and call its half, 8 lb., a
nail, though it is no longer the sixteenth of a larger unit.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the half of the 14-lb. stone was legally called
a nail, how was this term to be rendered into law-Latin
or statute French by the scribes of Plantagenet
times ignorant of the origin of the term? Naturally
they blundered; they got hold of the wrong nail,
rendering it by L. <i>clavus</i> instead of by <i>unguis</i>, and by
Fr. <i>clou</i>, <i>cloue</i>, or in the script of the time <i>clove</i> instead of
by <i>ongle</i>. This misnomer took; and a statute of
1430 states that a Wey of cheese may contain 32 cloves,
every clove 7 lb., making the wey = 224 lb., 2 Cwt.
But despite statutes the cheese-trade went on with
its 8-lb. clove, of which 32 make 256 lb., the true wey.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was the same with the wool-trade, controlled by
the State for revenue purposes. The half-stone of wool
became a nail. In 1342 we find <i>quatuor clavos lanæ</i>,
4 nails of wool.</p>

<p class='c014'>But <i>clavus</i>, a nail, became confounded with <i>clavis</i>, a
key, and so in Southern France the nail-weight, introduced
from England, became <i>clau</i>, a key, instead of
<i>clavèu</i>, a nail. Thus the nail, Fr. <i>once</i>, <i>ongle</i>, became
clove, Fr. <i>clou</i>, L. <i>clavis</i>, an iron nail; then in Prov.
and Fr. <i>clau</i>, L. <i>clavus</i>, a key.</p>

<h4 class='c045'>(<span class='fss'>A</span>) <i>The Carat</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>One would hardly recognise the golden Solidus of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Rome in the French Sol, the brass halfpenny with the
effigy of Louis XVI, current within my memory, or in
the bronze Sou by which sums under three francs are
still reckoned in France.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Solidus, Aureus, or Exagium solidi, was so
called because, representing the As, or unit of money,
it was the gold-unit of which the semissis was the half
and the tremissis the third.</p>

<p class='c014'>Weighing 70·1 grains (under Constantine) it was
1/6 of the Roman mint-ounce = 420-2/3 grains, or 1/72 of
the As libralis. Its weight was equal to 24 siliquæ,
afterwards called Carats = 2·921 grains, and its third,
the tremissis, weighed nearly 24 grains, the troy
pennyweight. Hence pure gold was considered as
solidus or ‘entire’ of 24 carats, and the quality or
‘touch’ of gold would be denoted by the number of
carats of pure gold it contained out of 24. The
carat of fineness was divided into 4 assay-grains, and
these again into fourths. English gold coins are
22 carats fine since the time of Henry VIII, but the
Plantagenet gold coins were usually 23 carats 3-1/2 grains
fine, that is 191/192 = nearly 995 in 1000.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus the carat was 1/24 Solidus or 1/144 ounce.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the Arab caliphs had conquered Egypt and
the greater part of the Mediterranean countries, they
followed Roman imperial customs and replaced the
gold Exagium solidi, 1/72 of the As, by the gold mithkal,
1/72 of the Libra or Egypto-Roman pound. The Mithkal
was then 1/6 of the Egypto-Roman ounce = 437 grains,
so that it weighed 72·7 grains. It was divided like the
Roman coin into 24 qirát, each = 3·035 grains and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>divided into 4 hubba or light grains, meaning corn-grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Ptolemaïc or lesser Alexandrian talent had been
divided into 60 minás of 12 ounces; these either 100
drachmæ or 12 × 12 carats of 3·1616 grains. The
carat was an ancient Eastern weight, originally the
flat seed of the caroub or locust-tree, <i>Ceratonia siliqua</i>,
and in Greek <i>keration</i>. Throughout North Africa
and in other Moslem countries there are two usual
lesser units of weight:</p>

<p class='c014'>The Eastern qirát has retained all the derived
senses seen in the Western carat, 1/24 of a pure gold-unit.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>A cubit of 28 digits has an alternative division into
24 qirát. The kharūb of Egypt, 16 to a dirhem and
24 to a mithkal, is the weight-counterpart of the digit,
16 to the foot and 24 to the cubit. The density of
brine is on a scale of 24 qirát. Points in a competition,
shares in a business or ship are reckoned
similarly. At Marseilles the ownership of a vessel is
divided into 24 qirát as it is in England into sixty-fourths.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Ai un queirat sus un navire’: <i>Calendau</i> v. (by
Mistral).</p>

<p class='c014'>Sometimes the 24 qirát are grouped into 4 <i>rob</i> of
6 qirát. <i>Rob</i> is from Ar. <i>al rabaa</i>, fourth; cf. <i>rubaiyat</i>
= quatrain. In Spain and Portugal the arroba, in
Provence the <i>rub</i> (It. <i>rubbio</i>) is the quarter-hundredweight.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>The Refiner’s Carat</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>There is another use of the term Carat, confined to
goldsmiths and refiners of the precious metals. The
old troy pound was regarded as 24 carats; the carat
was 4 grains, each of 4 quarters or of 60 grains. This
system was used in the refinery of the Royal Mint
up to 1882.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Germany the Cologne marc (8 ounces) was
divided by refiners (1) for gold into 24 carats of 12
grains; (2) for silver into 16 loth (half-ounces) of 18
grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is probable that this system came to England
with the Tower pound (12 ounces of the Cologne marc)
and was continued with the Troy pound.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>
  <h4 class='c047'>(<span class='fss'>B</span>) <i>The Grain</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c020'>The names given to the smaller weights were taken
from seeds just as measures of length were named after
limb-lengths corresponding roughly to them. The
kharoub may be used for a carat-weight. The ruttee
or ráti, a scarlet pea with a black spot, is used in India
as a goldsmith’s weight = 1·75 grain. Poppy-seeds,
mustard-seeds, barley-corns, wheat-corns, have been
used for minute weights. The Grain was the Greek
<i>sitatrion</i>, a wheat-corn. It was perhaps from the
custom of saying that 3 poppy-seeds = one mustard-seed,
and that 6 of these = one barley-corn, &amp;c.,
that an idea arose of these seeds being the basis of
systems of weight. It has been seen that the definition
of the Plantagenet mint-weight was that 32 wheat-corns
were the pennyweight. This idea, hallowed in our
statutes, is not yet extinct.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ambroise Paré, in treating of medicinal weights
(1582) said:</p>

<p class='c015'>Every weight arises from some beginning and element.
For as our bodies arise from the four first simple or elementary
bodies, so all weights arise from the grain, which is
<i>tanquam</i> the beginning and the end of the remainder. We
understand a grain of barley, neither dried nor mouldy, but
well made and of medium fatness. From 10 grains of this
sort comes the obolus, from 2 oboli or 20 grains the scruple
... &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is medieval rubbish. As John Greaves,
Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, in his ‘Discourse
of the Roman foot’ (1647) wisely said:</p>

<p class='c015'>I cannot but approve the counsel of Villapandus who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>adviseth such as will examine measures and weights to
begin with the greater and not the lesser.... The most
curious man alive with the exactest scale that the most
skilful artisan can invent, shall never be able, out of the
standard of one grain, to produce a weight equal to the
weight of ten thousand grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>While the subdivision of linear measures and of
weights usually stopped at some familiar quantity
named after a seed, yet efforts were sometimes made to
get at an ultimate atom as the term of the series.
The Hindus who began, or ended, a series of weights
with one of the motes or fine particles of dust visible
in a sunbeam, were imitated by the English moneyers
who continued the 20-dwt. and 24-grain series by
dividing the grains into 20 Mites, each of 24 Droits,
each of 20 Periots, each of 24 Blanks, the blank being
1/230400 of a grain.</p>

<p class='c014'>So our mint expressed the weight of a Stuart silver
penny, not as 7-23/31 grains (all the silver coins having
then a fraction of 31sts); that would have been too
simple—but as 7 grains, 14 mites, 20 droits, 2 periots,
12 blanks. Even then the statement was not exact;
one or two more infinitesimal units would have had
to be added to the series.</p>

<p class='c014'>It may be noted that 7-23/31 grains is simpler than the
modern decimal equivalent 7·74193548, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c014'>The origin of these mint-terms is obscure; the
‘N.E.D.’ casts no light on it. I consider their source
to be—</p>

<p class='c014'>Mite—mijt, a small Dutch coin.</p>

<p class='c014'>Droit—a corruption of the Dutch <i>duit</i>, Sc. ‘doit,’ a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>fraction of a farthing. It was more properly written
‘dwit’; perhaps the <i>r</i> was inserted to avoid confusion
with ‘dwt.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Periot—a period or full stop; perhaps influenced by
‘iota’ and ‘jot.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Blank—as the blank in dominoes, still lower than
the ace, point, or full stop, the Dutch As; perhaps
influenced by ‘point-blank,’ in which the bull’s eye,
at first the ‘point,’ became the blank or white.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has been seen, under Troy weight, that there
are two classes of grains:</p>

<p class='c014'>The heavy grain 1/(20 × 24) = 1/480 ounce as in English
Troy.</p>

<p class='c014'>The light grain 1/(24 × 24) = 1/576 ounce as in French
Troy.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ounce of 576 light grains was used in France,
some Italian states, Spain and Portugal. Elsewhere,
throughout Europe, the mint and medicinal ounce was
480 heavy grains, the scruple being 20 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>The heavy and light grains have been connected
respectively with the barley-corn and the wheat-corn.
They may have been so originally, but it is more
probable that the grain, at first a seed-weight, came
to mean a division of the scruple into either 20 or 24
parts.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Dutch mint-weight the Troy ounce was of
20 dwt. or Engels, each of 2 mail, 4 vierling, 8 troisken,
16 deusken, 32 azen or aces. The Aas was the wheat-corn
of our mint-legend. In the Spanish Netherlands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>the Engel was increased to make the ounce 24 × 24
grains. The Engel thus became (Antwerp 1580) =
28·8 grains = 1-1/5 English dwt. The word Engel means
‘angel,’ not the angel coin weighing 3 engel 10 azen,
but Angle—‘Angli, non Angeli.’</p>

<h3 class='c019'>4. <span class='sc'>The Tun and the Fother</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>These words belong to an onomatopœic class:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. Bung—akin to ‘bomb,’ to Fr. <i>bonbonne</i>, a
more or less globular vessel giving out a ‘bom’ sound
when struck. In Somerset the bung-hole of a cask is
the bum-hole; a ‘bun’ is a puffed somewhat semi-globular
cake. Bung was probably a cask; the word
is applied to a portly publican fancifully resembling
one of his casks. Bumboat probably meant a boat
carrying ‘bums’ or casks to ships.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. Ton, tun—a large cask giving a thundering sound.
L. <i>tonitru</i>, Fr. <i>tonnerre</i>, whence Fr. <i>tonne</i>, our ton for
weight, tun for capacity.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. Fr. <i>Foudre</i>, a ‘thundering big’ cask or vat. L.
<i>fulgur</i>, Fr. <i>fouldre</i>, <i>foudre</i>, a thunder-bolt, in German
<i>fuder</i>, whence our ‘fudder’ and ‘fother,’ about a ton

  <h2 id='XXI' class='c004'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE OLD MEASURES AND WEIGHTS OF FRANCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Up to the time of the Revolution each province had
its own measures and weights, more or less influenced
by the uncertain standard measures of the king in
Paris. This was the effect of the feudal system and
of the very gradual annexation of the provinces under
conditions which left considerable powers to the
parliaments and other local authorities. Even in each
province varieties of measures were to be found, and
they exist to this day in each <i>pays</i>, often in each parish.</p>

<p class='c014'>The basis of this very loose system was Roman,
influenced in the North by Teutonic importations, but
especially by the peculiar and intrinsically perfect
system of the South, where the Roman basis had
entirely disappeared under the influences of commerce
with Egypt and with that portion of Africa which
begins across the Pyrenees, and which in medieval
times imparted much of its high civilisation to European
countries.</p>

<h3 class='c019'><span class='sc'>1. The Southern System</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>This system, prevailing far beyond the limits of
Occitania, the land of the Lengo d’O, had for its basis
the Load of Wheat, a measure very nearly that of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>cubed Arabic cubit, and comparable with the English
Coomb or half-Quarter. Just as the English Quarter
of corn is 8 bushels, so the Cargo (load, or Saumado,
ass-load, Seam) is 8 Eimino. And just as we had a
wine-bushel, originally a cubic foot in water-wheat
ratio with the corn-bushel, so Occitania had its
Escandau for wine corresponding, in the Southern
water-wheat ratio of 1 to 1·22, to the Eimino or
Panau. The only difference in this evolution was
that, while our corn-measure was increased from
the wine-measure, the southern wine-measure, and
other measures evolved inversely from it, were produced
from the corn-measure as a basis. The word
Escandau means ‘standard’ (like the Denerel of
Guernsey), and just as the cubic measure, the quadrantal,
of 1000 Roman ounces of water, is the standard of our
foot and virtually of all our other measures, so the
Escandau-quadrantal is the standard of the Pán
and of all the other measures of Marseilles. I take the
standards of Marseilles as it was the great port of
trade in the South, and incidentally those of Arles,
the capital of the medieval kingdom of Arles or of
Burgundy, afterwards the republic of Arles. This
was so considerable a seaport, connected as it was with
the sea both by the Rhone and by a canal passage, the
Fossæ Marianæ, through the lagoons, that at one time
the Lion of Arles was a rival of its brother of St. Mark,
and gave its name to the Gulf which receives the Rhone.</p>

<p class='c014'>The process of involution by which the Pán of
Marseilles was derived from the side of an Escandau
of quadrantal form has been described in <a href='#Pan'>Chapter IV</a>.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>The Cano or fathom, = 79·24 inches, was 8 pán or
spans each = 9·904 inches; the span was of 8 menut
or inches, also divided into 8 parts.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The basis of the Southern system, typically that of
Marseilles, was then the Cargo, a corn-measure =
34·73 gallons (the equivalent of 154·79 litres, the official
metric value), which was the cubic cubit of Al-Mamūn:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>21·28 inches cubed = 9639 c.i. = 34·73 gallons.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Now what water or wine measure would be produced
from the Cargo, decreased in wheat-water ratio?</p>

<p class='c014'>Dividing the measure of the cargo by 1·22 we have:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>34·73/1·22 = 28·46 gallons.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>A fluid measure of this capacity is not in use at Marseilles,
but we find its half, almost exactly, in the
Mieirolo = 14·19 gallons, a wine and oil measure used
extensively in Mediterranean ports.</p>

<p class='c014'>The word Mieirolo, in which <i>mié</i> means half, corresponds
to the name of the first in an Italian series of
wine-measures:</p>

<p class='c014'>Mezzaruola, Terzaruola, Quartaruola, fractions of
a 28-gallon measure now apparently obsolete.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>One-fourth of the Mieirolo, or one-eighth of the
obsolete wine-cargo, is the Escandau, equal to the
Spanish arroba (a word meaning ‘quarter’), and
containing, at the present Marseilles standard, 16·096
litres = 3·54 gallons. To this Escandau or standard
corresponds, in water-wheat ratio, the Panau = 4·34
gallons, 1/8 of the Cargo = 4·34 bushels or 34·73 gallons.</p>

<p class='c014'>The correspondence of this series of wine and corn
measures, in southern water-wheat ratio, is perfect,
even after many centuries, probably since the tenth
century. The Escandau and the Panau or Eimino
correspond then to about 4 wine-gallons and 4 corn-gallons.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Escandau has always been understood to be a
cubic pán. Escandau<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a> means a standard; Pán means
a side, pane or panel, and it is the measure of the side
of a ‘quadrantal’ containing an Escandau of water,
as our foot is the measure of one containing an English
talent of 1000 Roman ounces of water. The cube root
of 16·096 litres is 25·24 centimetres, a length differing
by less than a millimetre from the standard of the
Marseilles pán = 25·16 centimetres or 9·9 inches.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Land-measures</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The ancient system of seed-measures, fixed geometrically,
survives to this day in Southern France,
indeed throughout most of France. I shall make no
apology for dwelling on it, for the linear land and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>cubic measures of Southern France show a perfectly
concordant system of measures, more so even than
those of England; indeed they are the type of a perfect
system.</p>

<p class='c014'>The largest unit of land is the Saumado, of 4 Sesteirado,
each of 2 Eiminado; these being originally
the ground that could be sown with a Saumado (or
Cargo), with a Sestié, with an Eimino, of wheat.</p>

<p class='c014'>These seed-measures of land corresponding to our
Coomb, Bushel and Peck land, became fixed respectively
at 1600, at 400, and at 200 square cano or fathoms.</p>

<p class='c014'>To the Sestié and the Sesteirado correspond the
<i>boisseau</i> and <i>boisselée</i> of Poitou and other provinces,
the <i>boisselée</i>, or bushel-land, being 400 square toises.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the surveyor’s measuring-rod is the Destre, a
double cano, of 16 pán = 13 ft. 2-1/2 in. In Languedoc,
west of the Rhone, the square destre = 4 square cano
is the smallest unit, so that the Saumado of land is
1600 square cano or 400 destre. But in Provence
the destre of land is 2 square cano, so that the Saumado
is 1600 square cano or 800 destre; the reason probably
being that the destre should be 2 cano superficial as it is
2 cano linear, and also that the Eiminado or peck-seedlip
of land should be 100 destre.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Eiminado is divided into quarters and sixteenths,
corresponding to the gallon and quart divisions
of the Eimino or peck. It is also divided into 20
Cosso, the ground corresponding to a cosso (= quart,
wine-measure) of seed.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is interesting to observe that the Saumado of 4
Sesteirado of 40 Cosso, corresponds, in division, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>our Acre of 4 roods, of 40 square rods.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c016'><sup>[49]</sup></a> And the
Cosso = 1/100 acre or 1/10 sq. chain.</p>

<p class='c014'>N.B.—1000 sq. cano = 1 acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Saumado, of 1600 sq. cano = 1·6 acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such is the typical system of Southern measures,
best preserved in the neighbourhood of Marseilles,
but prevailing throughout the Southern half of France,
though with local variations in the length of the cano
and the names of the land-units.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Measures of Capacity</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>These have mostly been given in the story of the
pán and in the seed-measures corresponding to the
land-measures.</p>

<p class='c014'>Throughout the system the divisions in each series
are sexdecimal, even the Cosso, 1/20 Eiminado, being 1/160
Saumado.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Weights</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>There were three types of pounds in South France,
local variations from these being very slight. The pound
was always 16 ounces, each of 8 ternau. The Ternau, so
called from its being divided into 3 pennyweights, was
the Arab dirhem. The three types of pound were:</p>

<p class='c014'>The Quintal was 100 of these pounds, but long
hundredweights were common. Its quarter was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Rub (Ar. <i>rouba</i>, four). These weights are nearly
obsolete, as the possession of any weights not of the
Republican system would be illegal. The measures
of length and capacity are often slightly altered so as
to be in metric units: the pán becomes a quarter-metre;
groceries are often ticketed by the hectogramme,
as this is known to coincide very closely with
the old Southern quarter-pound.</p>

<p class='c014'>We now pass to the Northern or Paris system,
mostly taken from the South, and bearing evident
traces of this origin.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>The Northern System</span></h3>

<h4 class='c045'><i>Measures of Length</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The Roman foot survived in North France as the
quarter of the Aune or ell, a measure = 46·77 inches.
(Cf. the passetto or double braccio of Tuscany, of 4
palmi = 45·96 inches.) As a cloth-measure the Aune
was divided, like our cloth-yard and ell, into eighths
and sixteenths.</p>

<p class='c014'>But there was also the pied de roi, the royal foot, one-sixth
of the Toise, which = 76·73 inches = 1·949 metre.</p>

<p class='c014'>The royal foot, = 12·789 inches, was divided into
inches (pouces) of 12 lines, each of 12 points. Its
standard was traditionally referred to Charlemagne,
either to the length of his foot, or to a standard brought
to him by the envoys of Harūn-al-Rashid. It coincides
with half a Hashími cubit, 25·56/2 = 12·78 inches.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>This tradition must be dismissed; new measures are
not introduced as standards in that way. It was
simply one-sixth of the toise, which was a Cano from
civilised South France, but its standard was so ill-kept
as to be of doubtful exactitude. All that is known of
its standard is that, about 1668, an iron rod was fixed
in a wall of the Grand Chatelet in Paris and that the
length of this rod was that of half the breadth of the
eastern gateway of the Louvre-palace, which gateway
was, according to the plans, 12 feet in breadth. This
standard was, however, considered to be 5/12 inch short
of the customary toise.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Louvre standard, taking it at = 1·965 metre
(which I find it by actual measurement), corresponds
closely to the Cano of Beaucaire. This town on the
southern Rhone, opposite Tarascon, had a great annual
fair, and may thus have given its linear standard to
trade in the same way that Marseilles passed the Cargo
of its Egyptian corn-trade on to Paris as the Setier, and
that Troyes passed the marc used at its great annual fair
on to Paris as the standard of the French troy pound.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c016'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>But the royal foot was inconveniently long for
popular use, and a practice arose of taking 11 inches of it
as a customary foot = 11·7 inches. This reduced foot,
coinciding almost exactly with the quarter-Aune, was
much used in the districts north of Paris as the <i>pied de
Ponthieu</i>, or <i>de Clermont</i>. The Brasse was a short fathom
of 5 pieds = 5 ft. 4 in., probably an adaptation of the
Roman pace. A <i>pas</i> (pace), of half a brasse = 32 inches,
is used in some districts for land-measurement.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Measures of Distance</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>There was no official measure of distance, such as
our furlong and mile, between the toise and the league,
and the league was very variable (see <a href='#III'>Chapter III</a>).
Acre-lengths, cordes, and other popular measures
supplied the want, more or less well. In some districts
(also in Mauritius) there were milestones at intervals
of 1000 toises, called a mille. In South France
the mille was divided into centenié of 100 toises or
perhaps local cano. This was probably the length
of the sesteirado, the rood, 100 × 4 cano.</p>

<p class='c014'>The corde, a field-measure used before the surveyor’s
chain, was of variable length. In Burgundy the
league of 3000 toises was divided for roadwork into
50 portées, of 12 cordes; these would thus be 5 toises
or 30 feet. But there seems also to have been a corde
of 33 feet, perhaps reduced feet, and thus = 30 royal
feet, and this, doubled, was used as the rough measure
of a ‘cord’ of firewood = 4 × 4 feet, in 4-foot logs.
This is the probable origin of our ‘cord-wood’ as
applied to stacked logs for fuel.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>
  <h4 class='c021'><i>Land-measures</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c020'>The units are the square toise = 4·543 sq. yards,
the perche and the arpent, with other units in local
usage.</p>

<p class='c014'>There were three different perches officially recognised,
and still in common use.</p>

<p class='c014'>1. <i>Perche d’ordonnance</i> or of the <i>Eaux et Forêts</i>
administration, 22 royal feet = 23·466 English feet;
the square perch of 484 sq. feet = 13·44 sq. toises =
2 sq. rods.</p>

<p class='c014'>The approximate coincidence of the quarter-aune
with the reduced royal foot, i.e. of 12 Roman inches
with 11 royal inches, was the probable reason of the
standard perch being fixed at 22 feet = 24 Roman
feet or 6 aunes.</p>

<p class='c014'>The standard arpent was 100 square perches =
1344 sq. toises = 200 rods or 1·26 acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. <i>Perche commune</i>, 20 royal feet = 21·3 English
feet, the square perch of 400 sq. feet = 11·11 sq.
toises = 50·47 sq. yards.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>arpent commun</i> was 100 of these square perches
= 1111 sq. toises = 1·04 acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. <i>Perche de Paris</i>, 18 royal feet = 19·83 English
feet, the square perch of 324 sq. feet = 9 sq. toises =
40·9 sq. yards.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>arpent de Paris</i> was 100 of these square perches
= 900 sq. toises = 0·844 acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>The arpent commun is that of Quebec.</p>

<p class='c014'>The arpent de Paris is that of Mauritius.</p>

<p class='c014'>The acre de Normandie varies according to its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>perch, but it is always 160 sq. perches, and if these
be standard it is equal to 2 acres. But the usual unit
is the vergée or rood, of 40 perches = 1/2 acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has been seen that the Jersey vergée is 40 perches
of 22 reduced English feet square, the foot being 11
inches. This is an adaptation of a very general
Normandy perch, 22 feet of 11 French inches. It is =
0·44 acre.</p>

<p class='c014'>Local French land-measures varied considerably,
from different standards of perch, from different
lengths taken for the foot of the perch. But the size
of the unit, Journal, Estrée, &amp;c., &amp;c., is very generally
= 1400 to 1600 square perches or roughly about 1-1/2
acre. These measures, so irrational to the Parisian,
are dear to the peasant’s heart; he understands them,
and as people do not buy land as they would apples
or eggs, no one is deceived.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Estrée or Seterée (Setier seed-land) might be
divided into 12 Boisselées (small-bushel lands).</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Weight</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The royal pound, <i>livre poids de marc</i>, the double-marc
of Troyes, was one of several pounds current in
Northern France. It was, like the royal foot, ascribed
to Charlemagne, but his standard of weight, as known
by his silver pennies, nearly always much above 24
grains, 1/20 of some ounce heavier than that of the Troyes
marc, was probably altered later on. The royal
pound, = 5570 grains, was raised for commercial
purposes (about 1350) to 16 ounces = 7554·1 grains,
the ounce = 472·13 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>The weight of the 12-ounce pound coincides very
closely with that of the Bosphoric miná, 100 drachmæ
of 56·66 grains; this is perhaps the origin of the story
that it was sent to Charlemagne by Harūn al Rashid.
Its ounce is also approximately the Tripoli ukyé
of 10 dirhems × 470-3/4 grains, and nearer still to 471
grains, the weight of 10 of the dirhems of which 8
made the Provençal ounce.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is probable that the French pound was one of
the lighter pounds of the variable Northern Troy
series, all with an ounce of 10 dirhems of 48 grains
more or less.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ounce was divided into 8 gros, groats or
drachms, of 3 deniers or dwt., each of 24 grains.
So the livre was 16 × 24 × 24 = 9216 French
grains. These were light grains, not the heavy grains,
20 × 24 to the ounce, of English and other mint-weights.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a Quintal of 100 livres = 107·7 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Tonne or tonneau was 2000 livres = 2154 lb.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Value</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The French coinage-system, probably instituted
by Charlemagne, was the same as ours. The original
unit was the silver penny, <i>estelin</i> (sterling) or denier
(L. <i>denarius</i>) of 24 French grains; 12 deniers made a
sol or sou (L. <i>solidus</i>, shilling) and 20 sols made the
livre or pound, originally a livre d’estelins, a 12-ounce
pound of sterlings. But the silver coinage shrank and
was debased, until, by the eighteenth century, the
pound, livre or franc was a silver coin worth tenpence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>the sol a copper halfpenny, and the denier had shrunk,
even as copper, to so minute a size that its place was
taken by the <i>liard</i>, a small copper coin of 3 deniers,
a quarter-sou; even the <i>double</i> of 2 deniers had disappeared.
Accounts were kept in livres and sols and
deniers, our £ <i>s.</i> <i>d.</i>, but at 1/25 the present value of our
coin.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>écu</i> of 3 livres, that is of 60 sous, was largely
used; wages of farm-servants are often at the present
day reckoned in écus. This was properly a <i>petit-écu</i>
or half-crown, but the real écu of 6 livres was so little
used that the smaller coin took its name. And, as
our half-crown has the great convenience of being
one-eighth of a sovereign, so the écu had that of being
one-eighth of a louis, the gold piece of 24 livres. This
was the value of the louis at par, for it varied as did
that of the guinea when England was a silver-standard
country.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Measures of Capacity</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>These measures, both the wine-series and the corn-series,
were quite discordant and had no relation to the
measures of length. That this was caused by an incoherent
system of factors is shown by there being in
each series a unit derived from the perfectly concordant
measures of the South:</p>

<p class='c014'>The wine-velte = 1·76 gallon, half of the Escandau.</p>

<p class='c014'>The corn-setier = 34·32 gallons, the Marseilles
Cargo.</p>

<p class='c014'>The former, when increased in water-wheat ratio, is
almost exactly 1/16 of the latter. So, had the former,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>increased in this ratio, been multiplied sexdecimally,
concordance would have been preserved. But there
was a customary Muid = 63-1/2 gallons, our hogshead,
with its quarter, our kilderkin, the Quartaut = 15·8
gallons, and not to derange these measures the
velte was made one-ninth of the Quartaut. And in
the corn-series the Setier was divided and multiplied
duodecimally. So the concordance was entirely
deranged.</p>

<p class='c014'>1. <i>Wine-measures.</i>—The Velte (the origin of which
is given in <a href='#XIX'>Chapter XIX</a>) was divided into 2 gallons
(our wine-gallon), 4 pots (our pottle), 8 pintes. The
last of these, = 1·76 pint, was about our old wine-quart,
= 32 oz., its half was a chopine or setier, = our
wine-pint, and the half of this was the demi-setier, a
name still current, the French equivalent of our
popular ‘half-pint.’</p>

<p class='c014'>2. <i>Corn-measures.</i>—The standard unit was the Setier
= 34·32 gallons, or 4·29 bushels, differing very slightly
from the Marseilles Cargo = 4·34 bushels. As the
Setier was an isolated measure, while the Cargo was
from early medieval times the basis of the complete
system of Southern measures, it may confidently be
inferred that the Paris unit of corn-measure was taken
from that of Marseilles, which was the Egyptian
Rebekeh, the cubed Arabic cubit.</p>

<p class='c014'>The term Setier is the L. <i>sextuarius</i>, but it had lost
its original meaning and become a general-utility term
in measures. The Setier = the Marseilles Cargo of
4 Sestié, must not be confused with this sestié. It was
divided into 12 boisseaux of variable standard, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>usually estimated to hold 20 French pounds of wheat.
As 1/12 setier, the boisseau was = 2·86 gallons, and
it was divided into 16 litrons = 1·43 pint.</p>

<p class='c014'>There were intermediate divisions of the Setier;
it was of 2 mines (a term taken from the Southern
<i>eimino</i>), 4 minots, 12 boisseaux.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was also a Muid for corn and salt. The corn-muid
was 12 setiers.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are still in France traces of an older system
of corn-measures derived from the cubic foot. I
found, in the Rouen Museum, the standard bushel of
the town of Bolbec. It measures 16 inches diameter
by 12·6 inches deep = 2533 cubic inches or 9·14
gallons. It appears to be the French cubic foot =
2091 cubic inches increased in water-wheat ratio to
2533 × 1·22 = 2551 cubic inches, a difference probably
to be ascribed to the difficulty in measuring at all
accurately.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are also many local standards of capacity,
well deserving of study. Some, as the bushel of La
Rochelle, indeed of the west of France generally, =
56 lb. of wheat, are much larger than the Paris Bushel.
There was a general rejection of the duodecimal division
of the Setier.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Remarks on the French Measures of Capacity</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The fault of the Paris system was that there
was little or no concordance between the different
series.</p>

<p class='c014'>In length, 6 aunes approximately coincided with
22 feet or 3-2/3 toises.</p>

<p class='c014'>The measures of length had no concordance with
those of capacity, and in the latter, wine-measure and
corn-measure had lost their original concordance when
they were brought from the south. They lost it by
two faults:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. By making the quartaut of 9 veltes instead
of 8;</p>

<p class='c014'>2. By dividing the setier into 12 boisseaux instead
of 8.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Had this octonary division been substituted, it
would have been quite satisfactory, and concordance
with the linear standard would have been obtained.</p>

<p class='c014'>A quartaut of 8 veltes, 8 × 1·76 = 14·08 gallons,
would have been in water-wheat ratio with the corn
half-setier = 17·16 gallons:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>14·08 × 1·22 = 17·17.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>And the setier divided into 8 parts would have given a
larger boisseau = 4·29 gallons (a peck) corresponding
in water-wheat ratio to the double velte of 4 gallons and
measuring approximately 1000 cubic pouces (983
exactly); its side, when of cubic form, being almost
10 pouces, and thus affording an easily applied
linear measurement as a check on the variation of the
boisseau. The standard of this measure was most
variable from want of such a check. Really, as 1/12
Setier it should have been 655·4 cubic pouces, but it
varied between 644 and 677, its reputed capacity
being 640 cubic pouces.</p>

<p class='c014'>It would have been easy to have fixed the new
boisseau at 1000 cubic pouces, raising the variable
standard of the Setier to 8000 cubic pouces = 34·9
gallons instead of its reputed standard = 34·32
gallons.</p>

<p class='c014'>By these slight alterations perfect accordance
with the southern measures would also have been
obtained.</p>

<p class='c014'>Leaving the measures of length and surface which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>were sufficiently concordant, the measures of capacity
would have been:</p>

former was, up to the fall of its powerful dukes in the sixteenth
century, a state enjoying prosperity and independence, while France
was mostly in a condition of misery. It had, and retained till
quite recently, its system of measures and weights, derived from
the southern system at the time when Arles was the capital of
the kingdom of Burgundy. It had two toises, one = 7-1/2 French
feet, the other, for field measure, = 9-1/2 French feet. Now the first
seems to have passed to England, for a time at least, for the <i>Liber
Albus</i>, 1419, contains an order for the City of London:</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The Toise of pavement to be 7-1/2 feet in length, and the foot
of St. Paul in breadth.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The great diversity in the weights and measures used
in different parts of France, and the discordance
between the series of the official system, or want of
system, were inconvenient, and tended to become
more so with the increasing facilities of communication
between the provinces. Unification was required,
and was being studied at the time when the Revolution
broke out.</p>

<p class='c014'>The obvious plan was to make such alterations in
the Paris system as were strictly necessary, keeping
to the main standards of length and capacity, standards
not irreconcilable, and to make it obligatory throughout
France. As Napoleon said, ‘It was so simple that it
could have been done in twenty-four hours, and
adopted throughout France in less than a year.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Amendments such as I have sketched in the <a href='#XXI'>last chapter</a>
would have answered the purpose sufficiently.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ostensible plan of the new system of weights
and measures was (May 8, 1790) ‘to create them anew
on invariable bases, and to establish in commercial
calculations the uniformity which Reason has vainly
called for during so many centuries, and which must
form a new bond between men.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>Even this scientific and fraternal plan, at first on
the basis of a normal pendulum-length, 3/4 inch longer
than the half-toise (as proposed by James Watt in
1783), might have been carried out so as to disturb the
hereditary ideas and customs of the people as little
as possible. But it was resolved to take a geodesical
basis. This, taken afresh and not accurately, for the
metre, was already at hand in a toise equal to the
Olympic fathom, 1/1000 of the meridian mile. And in
the report to the Convention, it was recognised that
the most ancient people had measures derived from
the terrestrial meridian.</p>

<p class='c014'>More than two centuries before the Revolution
an abbé (Mouton) had proposed a revival of the Olympic
system, decimalised from the meridian mile down to a
digit, 1/100 of the fathom.</p>

<p class='c014'>Without this decimalisation, at least in the popular
series of measures, there was a geodesic basis—for this
was resolved as necessary—already at hand in the
Olympic system, and the Olympic foot cubed would
have given a unit of capacity and the Olympic talent
one of weight, all the more suitable inasmuch as 1/1000
of it would have been an ounce = 453·6 grains, closely
approximating to the Cologne ounce and therefore
likely to be acceptable in other countries. But the
real object was to make a clean sweep of the past; and
the formation of a Republican system of measures was
entrusted to mathematicians and other scientists
who did not consider that a system convenient to
them might be very inconvenient to unscientific people.
The division of all measures must be on an obligatory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>decimal system convenient to mathematicians and
most inconvenient to nearly everyone else.</p>

<p class='c014'>The basis of the new system was a measure considered
to be one ten-millionth of the quarter-meridian,
of the distance from the equator to the pole. This
unit was neither original in conception nor exact in
measurement. When Aristotle divided the circumference
of the globe into 400,000 stadia, instead of the
240,000 stadia of 1000 Olympic fathoms, his stadion,
1/100,000 of the quarter-meridian, was equal to 100
metres. But there was no practical advantage in it,
and navigators continued to use the nautical mile
of 10 Olympic stadia, as they do to this day.</p>

<p class='c014'>At least Aristotle did not seek to upset all the
weights and measures of the Macedonian empire;
and his stadion disappeared.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is doubtful if absolute exactness will ever be
attained in the measurement of the surface of our
globe, irregularly spherical in form and of very uneven
surface; but there is no doubt that the ancient
Chaldæans and Egyptians measured it sixty centuries
ago quite as accurately as the astronomers of the first
Republic; and the Olympic standard of the meridian
mile, not the kilometre, is the unit used to this day by
the navigators of France as by those of every other
maritime nation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Having determined with little exactitude the
metric decimal fraction of the quarter-meridian, the
astronomers and mathematicians of the Republic, <i>les
idéologues</i> as Napoleon called them, proceeded to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>evolve from it the most inconvenient possible units
of length, surface, capacity, and weight. All that
could be said for these units is that they were exactly
and decimally derived from the metre. The metre
was unacceptable to the people, as no metric unit of
length corresponds even approximately to the universal
limb-units of fathom, cubit, foot, span, palm, finger or
thumb-breadth. The different series admit only the
factors, 1, 2, 5; so each decimal unit has a half (0·5)
and a double, but no quarter or third. The prefixes—in
Latin for divisions, <i>deci</i>, <i>centi</i>, <i>milli</i>; in Greek for
multiples, <i>deca</i>, <i>hecto</i>, <i>kilo</i>, <i>myria</i>—give the only names
allowed.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Length</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The Metre, = 39·370113 inches, is divided into
10 decimetres, 100 centimetres, 1000 millimetres.</p>

<p class='c014'>1 yard = 0·9144 metre; 1 foot = 0·3048 metre;
1 inch = 0·0254 metre, or 2·54 centimetres.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is multiplied by 10 for the decametre, by 100 for
the hectometre, by 1000 for the kilometre, by 10,000
for the myriametre. Practically the kilometre, =
0·621 mile or 1093·6 yards, is the only larger unit used;
the other units are useless. And though it be interesting
to know that the kilometre is approximately 1/10,000
of the quarter-meridian, it is a useless fact.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Surface</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The square metre = 1·196 square yard. The
lower units are little used. For land-measurement
the square decametre, 10 × 10 metres, is called an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Are; 100 ares = 100 × 100 metres, make a Hectare =
2·47 acres; and the square metre is a Centiare.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 acre = 0·40468 hectare.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Solidity</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The cubic metre = 35·315 cubic feet (nearly the
volume of a ton of water = 35·84 cubic feet) contains
1000 cubic decimetres, each of 1000 cubic centimetres
(= 61 cubic inches).</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 cubic foot = 0·028317 cubic metre.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The cubic centimetre is strictly speaking 1/1000
cubic decimetre, but as used in chemistry for fluid
measure it is considered as 1/1000 of the litre, which is
only approximately a cubic decimetre.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Capacity</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The Litre was originally a cubic decimetre, but
this definition has been abandoned. It is now defined
as the volume of a kilogramme of pure water in air
at 4 degrees Centigrade = 39·2° Fahrenheit.</p>

<p class='c014'>At ordinary temperatures a litre of water weighs
about 998·8 grammes or 0·9988 kilogramme (see Table
at end of <a href='#Water'>Chap. X</a>).</p>

<p class='c014'>The only minor unit practically used (and only in
scientific work) is the millilitre, under the name of
cubic centimetre, = 15·432 grains of water.</p>

<p class='c014'>1 Litre = 2·204 lb. water, or 1·76 pint.</p>

<p class='c014'>1 Pint = 0·568 litre; 1 gallon = 4·546 litres.</p>

<p class='c014'>The principal larger unit is the Hectolitre = 22·04
gallons or 2·75 bushels. The Decalitre = 2·2 gallons.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>1 Bushel = 36·37 litres; 1 Quarter 291 litres
or nearly 3 hectolitres.</p>

<p class='c014'>1 Bushel to the acre = 0·9 hectolitre to the hectare.
(Deduct 1/10 on English.)</p>

<p class='c014'>1 Hectolitre to the hectare = 1·11 bushel to the
acre. (Add 1/10 to French.)</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Weight</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The original unit was the Gramme, defined as the
weight of a cubic centimetre of water at 4° Centigrade
= 15·432 grains. It is divided into 10 decigrammes,
100 centigrammes, 1000 milligrammes. Of its multiples
the decagramme is useless; the hectogramme is
merely the name inscribed on a 100-gramme weight;
the kilogramme of 1000 grammes is used when its
use cannot be avoided.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the present legal unit is not the gramme but
the kilogramme = 2·2046 lb. or 15,432 grains.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c016'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Intended to be the weight of a cubic decimetre of
water at 4° C. (as the gramme was that of a cubic
centimetre), this definition has been abandoned as
inexact; it is now, like our pound, the mass of a certain
platinum standard, in a vacuum.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Practically, the unit of weight in the ordinary
transactions of life is the ‘half-kilo’ of 500 grammes,
more usually known as a livre or pound, though the
use of this word in trade is punishable.</p>

<p class='c014'>The livre or half-kilo = 1·1 lb. or 7716 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>1 kilo = 2·2046 lb. or 15,432 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>100 kilos or Quintal metrique = 220·46 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>1000 kilos or Tonne 2204·6 lb. = 0·984 ton.</p>

<p class='c014'>1 ton = 1016 kilos; 1 cwt. = 50·8 kilos; 1 lb. =
0·4536 kilo or 453·6 grammes.</p>

<p class='c014'>1 ounce = 28·35 grammes; 1 grain = 6·48 centigrammes.</p>

<p class='c014'>100 kilos of wheat = 3·53 bushels, at 62-1/2 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>100 litres (1 hectolitre) of wheat = 2·75 bushels.</p>

<p class='c014'>7 fr. duty on 100 kilos wheat = 2 fr. a bushel or
12<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a quarter.</p>

<p class='c014'>1 bushel = 36·4 litres.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Money</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The monetary unit is the Franc, practically the
same as the old livre, somewhat less. According to
the original plan, the Republican franc was to be 10
grammes weight, so that the decimal harmony of the
system should not be disturbed. But financial
expediency required it to be of about the same weight
as before, so 80 old livres were recoined as 81 francs
at 5 grammes weight and 0·900 fineness. The franc
was to be of 100 centimes instead of 20 sous of 4 liards.</p>

<p class='c014'>The copper coins, changed to bronze in about
1854, are pieces of 10 and 5 centimes, the latter
equivalent to the old sou, so that the franc is commonly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>called a 20-sou piece, and the other silver coins,
nominally of 5, 2, and 1/2 franc, are called in the same way
<i>pièces de cent sous</i>, <i>quarante sous</i> and <i>dix sous</i>. The
centime is so rarely seen as to be practically non-existent,
and the decimal system not allowing the half
or quarter of the 5-centime piece or sou, great inconvenience
is felt by the poor,<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c016'><sup>[53]</sup></a> yet the symmetry of the
system has been marred by the issue of nickel quarter-francs,
of a size which makes them often undistinguishable
from francs. But this is 25 centimes, while the
half-sou would be written 2·5 centimes, marring
the symmetry of the centime column in accounts—where
practically it would never appear.</p>

<p class='c014'>Since the adoption of a gold standard under the
second Empire, the gold 20-franc piece is the standard
of exchange, and of payments in trade. It weighs
6·451 grammes = 99·5635 grains; it is of 0·900 fineness
(= 22-1/5 carats) and thus contains 86·6071 grains of
pure gold. Its exchange value is usually 15<i>s.</i> 10-1/2<i>d.</i>,
our sovereign being equal to 25 francs 20 centimes.</p>

<p class='c014'>The system of international currency has led to
the French currency containing coins, both gold
and silver, of strange devices, and the necessity of
placards in shops showing figures of the numerous
coins which should not be accepted. Considerable
vigilance is necessary to avoid taking coins not current,
or taking for francs the nickel five-sou pieces
scarcely distinguishable from them except in a good
light.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>
  <h4 class='c021'><i>Temperature</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c020'>The French thermometer, called Centigrade (the
proper term would have been centesimal), is on Celsius’s
scale, of 100 degrees between the freezing and boiling
points of water, under the normal atmospheric pressure,
which for France is 760 millimetres = 29·92
inches.</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>Metric Measures of Time</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>These are dropped, officially, at present; but they
may be re-established, for they were the essential part
of the Republican system. Ardent republicans constantly
claim their re-establishment, and sound republican
newspapers, dated according to the republican
calendar, take care that this shall not be forgotten.
Scientific journals demand the re-establishment of
decimal time and decimal degrees; for even to sell
eggs or handkerchiefs by the dozen is a sin, and ought
to be made a crime, against the decimal system.</p>

<p class='c014'>Republican zeal, unable to reform the solar system,
had to content itself with reviving the ancient Egyptian
year of twelve equal months followed by five extra
days, to be called Jours Sansculottides, and with
instituting a new era. The extra day of leap-years
made a sixth sansculottide; these years were therefore
sextile, and the period of four years ending with leap-year
was to be called a Franciade.</p>

<p class='c014'>In justice to the authors of the Metric system, it
must be said that they were not responsible for the
Republican calendar; this was the work of a separate
Committee, to whom the Convention handed over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>work carried out by the Weights and Measures Committee
of the Académie des Sciences. On August 1,
1793, it thanked the W. and M. Committee for their
work, on the 6th it closed all the Academies, and soon
after sent the great chemist Lavoisier, the principal
member of the Committee, to prison and ultimately
to the scaffold. Among the small number of real republicans
who ruled France from Paris, there was much
less enthusiasm for the metric system, intended to sweep
away the memory of the old customs of weights and
measures, than for the calendar, the essential part
of which was a new era and the sweeping away of past
superstitions, whether Pagan or Christian. In both
cases one can see the power of a very small but
enthusiastic, well-organised and violent minority of
Jacobins against the large, but unorganised and
terrorised, majority of the French people. In both
cases we see the truth of Guizot’s saying: ‘Blind
aversion for the past is full of falsehood and of ignorance.’<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c016'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The decree instituting the complete Republican
system began by these words, characteristic of the times:</p>

<p class='c015'>The French era begins with the foundation of the
Republic, which was on 22nd September 1792 of the
vulgar era, the day when the sun arrived at the true
autumnal equinox, entering the sign of the Balance, at
9h. 18m. 30s. a.m., Paris Observatory time.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thus (it continued) the heavens marked the equality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>of days and nights at the same moment that civil and
moral equality was proclaimed by the representatives of
the French people as the sacred foundation of its new
government.</p>

<p class='c014'>The month was divided into three decades and the
days of the decimal week were numbered from one to ten.</p>

<p class='c014'>The saints whose names had been attached to the
days were abolished. They were replaced by objects
of republican veneration, animals, vegetables, minerals,
tools, &amp;c. Each Decadi was consecrated to an agricultural
implement, the plough, the watering-pot, the
pitchfork, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c014'>Each Quintidi was consecrated to a useful animal,
the horse, the ass, the pig, the trout, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c014'>The eight other days of the decade were consecrated
to plants, &amp;c. It was difficult to find 288 useful plants,
but by bringing in such as the nettle, the dandelion
(under its vulgar French name), strange plants discovered
in a herbal dictionary, together with the manure
heap and a few useful minerals, the saints were entirely
replaced. To popularise these substitutes for the
<i>ci-devant</i> saints an appendix to the Decadaire or
Annuaire (for the term Calendar was abolished as
savouring of superstition) gave popular information,
in the crudest terms, on the diseases for which the
vegetables and herbs were recommended by the
scientific advisers of the Republic.</p>

<p class='c014'>To complete this system, the circles of the globe,
and all other circles, were divided into 400 degrees,
divided decimally. The day was divided into 10 hours,
of 100 decimal minutes, each of 100 decimal seconds.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>The republican division of the day was not generally
put into practice except in official documents,
probably because the Jacobin leaders found it personally
inconvenient. Decreed as obligatory in Frimaire,
an II, it was suspended in Germinal, an III, yet that
it was extant, if not in force, up to 1800 is shown by
a police-report of an occurrence on ‘21 Brumaire an
VIII à 2 heures 10 minutes décimales,’ i.e. at 5 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span></p>

<p class='c014'>The story of the means by which the unpopular
republican measures were enforced has not yet been
told. Some idea of it may be guessed from a remark
of de Bonald (1817):</p>

<p class='c015'>I believe that the same firmness, rigour, and lavish
expenditure, used to establish, or rather to try and
establish, uniformity of weights and measures, would have
been sufficient to establish uniformity of religion.</p>

<p class='c014'>If in a country which had experienced Louis XIV’s
system for establishing uniformity of religion, this
could be said of the means by which the republican
weights and measures were enforced, it is evident that
the new system met with anything but the welcome
usually supposed.</p>

<p class='c014'>But a man had arisen who delivered France, for a
time at least, from the more objectionable parts of the
republican measures, and the good he effected in this
way had doubtless much to do with his popularity.
From the time of his Consulate, at the end of 1799,
the rigour of the system was gradually relaxed. His
contempt for the mathematician-advisers of the
Republic, whom he had found to be incapable in public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>business, was probably brought to a climax by the
following event.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ordnance survey-maps of France were on
Cassini’s scale of 1/86,400, i.e. 1 line to 100 toises (which
is the proportion of the second to the mean day). A
new map having been made on the metric scale of
1/100,000, Napoleon soon found this out, and ordered
the map to be restored to the old scale.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Je la veux sur l’échelle de Cassini, et je me moque
des divisions décimales’ (letter to the Minister of
War, 1809).</p>

<p class='c014'>The republican calendar and era were used until
the end of 1805, when Napoleon restored the Gregorian
calendar and its era; thus 11 Nivose, an XIV, was
the last day of the republican system.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the republican idea of a new calendar and a
new era is not dead; it has so little died out that a
calendar and era devised by a French mathematician
and sociologist in 1852 is now actually used, not only
in France, but in England, and also in Brazil, by the
followers of this reformer.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c016'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>HOW THE METRIC SYSTEM WORKS IN FRANCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Napoleon, who had witnessed the rigorous measures
of the Republican government to enforce its metric
system, said of it:</p>

<p class='c015'>It violently broke up the customs and habits of the
people as might have been done by some Greek or Tartar
tyrant who, with uplifted rod, wills to be obeyed in all
his decrees, regulated by his prejudices or his interests,
without any regard for those of the conqueror.... It
was tormenting the people for trifles.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c016'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>But he was too wise to disturb trade again by any
change in the material standards, however objectionable;
he kept these, while abolishing the unpopular
decimal series.</p>

<p class='c014'>The decree of February 12, 1812, accordingly
ordered that weights and measures, while being
strictly in accordance with the existing standard units,
should have ‘such fractions and multiples as were
generally used in trade and were best suited to the
needs of the people.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>A double-metre became the new Toise, divided,
like the old toise, into 6 feet of 12 inches. The Aune
was to be 1·2 metre.</p>

<p class='c014'>The hectolitre and the litre were divided sexdecimally,
one-fourth of the hectolitre becoming a
double-Boisseau differing very slightly from the old
measure of the same name.</p>

<p class='c014'>The half-kilogramme became the Livre, divided
into 16 ounces, these being divided into eighths. The
Quintal was 100 livres, the millier 1000 livres, the
tonneau 2000 livres.</p>

<p class='c014'>With regard to money, the gold napoleon being
20 francs and the franc of 20 sous, divided into 4 liards
or half-farthings, the system was convenient.</p>

<p class='c014'>This practical though incomplete compromise was
in force until 1837, when Louis-Philippe restored, on
paper at least, the full republican system, except the
measures of time. Yet the Napoleonic compromise
held its ground, and indeed has lost little up to the
present day, notwithstanding a more rigorous enforcement
of the decimal system under the second Empire
and the third Republic.</p>

<p class='c014'>About 1859 began the propaganda of the metric
system abroad. Holland and Belgium, on which it
had been imposed when those countries were seized
by France in 1792 and 1795, retained it after the peace of
1814-1815; at least the old systems had been destroyed,
and it was deemed best to retain the new one, so in
1821 it was compulsory.</p>

<p class='c014'>The new kingdom of Italy threw away the remains
of its metric inheritance from ancient Rome when in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>1859 it took the French system, partly perhaps from
the apparent difficulty of co-ordinating the measures
of the different states, but probably as part consideration
for French help against Austria.</p>

<p class='c014'>Portugal adopted it, on paper at least, in 1863.</p>

<p class='c014'>The worst was when, in 1868, it was adopted by the
North German Confederated States, and when in 1872
it was made compulsory.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is said that the governing powers of Germany,
anxious to unify the diverse systems of its component
states, took the fatal step in consequence of English
official assurances that the metric system would soon
be imposed on the British empire. After this disastrous
surrender to international science, the governments of
other countries, large and small, civilised and semi-barbarous,
were easily induced by skilful diplomacy
to impose the French republican measures on their
peoples, heedless of the fact that all the persuasion
and pressure of the French government had failed
to get its own people to use the system whenever it
could be evaded.</p>

<p class='c014'>Herbert Spencer says, of the progress of the metric
system:</p>

<p class='c015'>When fifty years after its nominal establishment in
France the metric system was made compulsory, it was not
because those who had to measure out commodities over
the counter wished to use it, but because the government
commanded them to do so, and when it was adopted in
Germany under the Bismarckian regime we may be sure
that the opinions of shop-keepers were not asked. Similarly
elsewhere, its adoption has resulted from the official will
and not from the popular will.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>The gradual adoption of the metric system by
countries of all degrees of civilisation from Germany
and Italy to Venezuela or Haïti, has not been from
any desire of the people of those countries for it, except
an infinitely small minority of scientists who desire
that the whole world should use the system found
convenient in international scientific reports, and a
somewhat larger proportion of enthusiasts with high
and unpractical cosmopolitan ideals. Many also
acquiesce from the same motive which induces people
to buy a well-advertised and puffed article instead of
one to which they had been accustomed and had
found satisfactory. They undergo the contagion to
which the crowd-mind is so subject. In England a
few genuine enthusiasts, and many more who have
caught the scientific and cosmopolitan craze, take to
the metric system as they take to learning Esperanto,
and so long as they have not to use the one in business
or the other in conversation, their enthusiasm lasts,
especially when it affords opportunities for showing
themselves friends of science and progress. But when
the contagion spreads so wide that it threatens to
revolutionise the habits and customs of a nation and
its whole manufactures and trade, the danger is
most serious.</p>

<p class='c014'>The favour which the metric system has found
amongst a small proportion of English people is largely
due to their ignorance of their own system, an ignorance
very excusable when there exists no official statement
of our system, or even of its standards. The people
are left to the information afforded very badly in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>school-books and scarcely better in almanacks. So
our system is left without defence against the attacks
made on it by well-meaning persons who do not know
it, and by the never-ceasing action of the French
government.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c016'><sup>[57]</sup></a> It may therefore be interesting to see</p>

<h4 class='c021'><i>How far the French have adopted the Metric System.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>A century of official pressure, of state-education,
and of police proceedings against any public selling,
marking or crying of goods otherwise than in metric
measures and coins, cannot be without some effect,
especially in large towns, but even there, while accounts
are kept and bills made according to the legal system,
the people, as distinguished from the official classes,
have never taken to it, and in the country it is nearly
entirely ignored, out of official transactions, both in
weight and measures and in money.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sizes of baskets and flower-pots are in <i>pouces</i>;
lamp-chimneys have their size marked on them in
<i>lignes</i>. The size of printer’s type is in points, each
1/6 line or 1/72 of the old French inch; and the printer’s
pocket-rule is divided on one side into centimetres
but on the other into ‘Ciceros’ corresponding to the
English ‘pica.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Barometers for ship-use have their scale usually
in pouces and lignes. The port barometer on the
quay of the great naval port of Toulon, in front of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>the town-hall, is on this old scale. In 1909 I found
the barometer of a new Transatlantique passenger
steamer making her first voyage to be ‘selon Torricelly,’
with its scale in the old <i>pouces</i>, 28 = 29·87
English inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sounding line of French ships is in brasses of
5 old French feet, the cable is of 120 brasses, the knot
is, as with us, 1/120 of the nautical mile of 1852 metres;
the kilometre being absolutely ignored.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Southern France the lengths of boats, as at
regattas, is stated in páns, taken at 1/4 metre.</p>

<p class='c014'>Wine is sold wholesale by the queue, by the barrique,
by the feuillette. A barrique or piece of Bordeaux
wine is 228 litres, of Burgundy 212 litres. Trade-units
are as common in France as in England.</p>

<p class='c014'>The housewife continues to ask for a four-pound
loaf, a <i>pain de quatre livres</i>, for a <i>livre</i> of sugar, for
a <i>demi-livre</i> of coffee, for <i>un quart</i> of chicory, for a
<i>demi-quart</i> or for <i>une once</i> of pepper. In the market-place,
in the streets fruit is openly cried at <i>quatre sous
la livre!</i> or <i>deux sous le quart!</i> when no policeman
is within hearing, and the police are discreetly deaf,
even in Paris, except when ordered to be more vigilant;
but then they kindly give a hint to the costermongers
and street-traders and, after a few days of conformity
to the law, the cries go on as before.</p>

<p class='c014'>The grocer does not ticket his wares by the kilo,
rarely even by the demi-kilo; he wisely tickets them
with a simple 50, or 75, or 80, which means 5<i>d.</i>, 7-1/2<i>d.</i>,
8<i>d.</i>, in coin, 10, 15, 16 sous, for a weight which is not
mentioned but is understood to be <i>une livre</i>, and which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>can be halved and quartered down to an ounce. He
finds that his customers are thus better pleased than
if the ticket had ‘1/2 kilo’ marked on it, and he knows
that they would be repelled if the price was by the
kilo. About the only exception is when the price of
goods cannot be expressed in centimes; thus if
potatoes are less than, say, 2 sous a pound, the greengrocer
has to ticket them ‘15 le kilo,’ 2 pounds for
3 sous. The practical non-existence of the centime,
and the refusal of government to coin half-sous or
farthings of 2-1/2 centimes, obliges him thus exceptionally
to use the word ‘kilo.’</p>

<p class='c014'>When a <i>quart</i>, a quarter-lb., say of coffee, is asked
for, the grocer has to put into the scale three weights,
of 100, 20 and 5 grammes, for a demi-livre two weights
of 200 and 50 grammes, instead of being able to use
a single half- or quarter-pound weight as under the
Napoleonic compromise. For an ounce he gives
30 grammes.</p>

<p class='c014'>In country towns goods are often openly ticketed
in sous; I have even seen ‘six liards,’ six half-farthings,
two for three-halfpence, as the marked price. In the
South books and newspapers sometimes have the
price boldly printed in sous, ‘20 sous,’ &amp;c. In large
shops, especially where there is a cash-desk, the
salesmen have trained themselves to speak only of
francs and centimes, but the smaller shopkeepers,
even in Paris, usually say their prices in sous, at least
for prices under two or three francs.</p>

<p class='c014'>The peasant bargains for cattle in écus (half-crowns)
or in pistoles of 10 francs; wages of farm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>labourers are still often in écus. Land is reckoned in
the old measures according to local custom, and tables
of these measures, with their metric equivalents,
are given in the ‘Usages Locaux’ published for the
use of <i>juges de paix</i> and other officials. Farms to
let and land for sale are frequently advertised in these
local measures. If the extent is given in hectares,
the local equivalent in vergées, seterées, &amp;c., is added.
I have such advertisements of recent date.</p>

<p class='c014'>The master of a government school in Normandy
advertised the sale of his haystack by auction. The
advertisement (in a newspaper of 1906, now before me)
gave the weight of the hay as ‘5000 kilos (10,000
livres).’ He knew that the fathers of his pupils
understood, as well as he did, a kilo to be 2 pounds,
but he also knew that they would be much readier to
bid if the weight was stated in pounds.</p>

<p class='c014'>Market-prices of agricultural produce are frequently
stated by newspapers in the old measures; that of
apples is constantly recorded by the barattée, literally
the churnful, about equal to our bushel.</p>

<p class='c014'>The old agrarian measures are used quite close to
Paris. I ask a farmer, not six miles from Paris, how
much land he has, and he, knowing me to be ‘safe,’
says so many estrées. How much is an estrée? 1600
square toises is his answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>I take up a Paris daily paper and see several advertisements
of mushroom farms for sale, in the old
quarries near Paris; the area of these is always given
in toises.</p>

<p class='c014'>Direct inquiries will always be answered most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>favourably to the metric system. The peasant’s
caution will rarely let the inquirer detect his love of
the old weights and measures, quite convenient to him.
And the bourgeois, proud of his superior education
and glorying in the triumphs of the metric system
abroad, ignores the existence of any but the legal
system; he is blind and deaf to the constant evidence
which strikes the unprejudiced observer.</p>

<p class='c014'>The doctor and the druggist would indignantly
deny using any other than metric measures, but they
have their professional units, necessarily on a gramme
basis, though in figures corresponding to ounces, tablespoons,
drachms, scruples and grains; drops (which
are actually dropped, not measured) are prescribed,
and the mixture is always made up to a total of so
many ounces of 30 grammes. And the pharmacien,
who is able to read through the frequent ambiguities
of prescriptions written in grammes, centigrammes,
&amp;c., very likely to be confused, puts the mixture
up in bottles which are moulded to show tablespoons
of 15 grammes, that is half-ounces.</p>

<p class='c014'>The druggists’ price lists give quantities in units
of 30, 125, 250, 500 grammes or cubic centimetres,
that is in quantities of 1, 4, 8, 16 ounces; and these
are the quantities in which he usually sells drugs to
his customers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus in France there is a chronic struggle between
the law and the people; the system of weights and
measures was devised there, not for the convenience
of the people, but to suit a decimal theory dear to the
mathematical and bureaucratic mind; the people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>must make their convenience fit the system, and it is
only by evasions and subterfuges that it can be made
to fit, even approximately. The trader has to evade
the law if he wishes to retain his customers. The
manufacturer, not keeping an open shop, finds evasion
easier, and all the circulars addressed by the government
to Chambers of Commerce begging them to
support the metric system remain without effect. A
few months ago a circular deplored the practice of
selling and buying silkworms’ eggs by the ounce.
Recently a circular forbade professors and schoolmasters
to utter the names of the old weights, measures
or coins, or to allow their pupils to utter them.</p>

<p class='c014'>The instances I have given of the failure of all the
efforts to make the French people take to the metric
system are entirely from my personal observation. I
conclude them with an extract from Messrs. Halsey
and Dale’s ‘The Metric Fallacy’ (New York, 1904)
on the failure to convert manufacturers to the system:</p>

<p class='c015'>The reasons for the failure of this colossal effort of a
century to change the textile weights and measures of
France is not difficult to find. The ideas of length, area,
volume and weight are as firmly grounded as any that find
a lodging in the mind of man. They are bound to the
records of the past, to the work of the present, and to the
plans for the future. They are ineffaceably imprinted
upon the mind of every child to regulate his ideas of
extension and weight as long as life may last.</p>

<p class='c015'>These natural conditions are alone sufficient to account
for the failure of the metric system in France. Other
influences have however served to make the failure more
complete in the textile industry. The metric system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>needed something more than the transcendent mathematical
faculties of its designers to make it suitable for
textile measurements.</p>

<p class='c015'>The eminent scientists who designed that system were
able to solve the most difficult problems in higher mathematics,
but failed to comprehend what system of weights
and measures was best suited for the carder, spinner,
weaver and finisher of wool, cotton, linen and silk. The
glamor of their fame failed to make the centimetre suitable
for counting ‘picks.’ Their system had to stand or fall
on its merits, and falling has proved that the highest of
mathematical abilities is not inconsistent with a dense
ignorance of the practical affairs of every-day life.</p>

<p class='c014'>I strongly recommend Messrs. Halsey and Dale’s
book to those who wish to know the opinion of American
engineers and manufacturers on the metric system.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE CONFLICT OF THE IMPERIAL AND METRIC<br />SYSTEMS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Two systems are face to face throughout the West—the
Imperial system resting on long custom and on
convenience, and the Metric system on an assumption
of science and on revolt against the past. It has been
shown that the system which pretends to be the only
scientific one, and the easiest, is a failure even in
France; but there, like the republic which gave it
birth, it is, under the influence of patriotism or national
pride, strong for attack abroad while in a state of
anarchy at home, worrying manufacturers and evaded
in trade whenever police-force fails to have jurisdiction
or deems it prudent not to prosecute.</p>

<p class='c014'>The one makes men fit the measures however inconvenient;
the other makes measures to fit those
who have to use them. The one attacks; the other
apposes a passive resistance.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us take a general view of the system attacked.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>General View of the Imperial System</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The Imperial system of Weights and Measures
rests on principles quite as rational and scientific as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>those of the Metric system, and it is much more
practical.</p>

<p class='c014'>All its series are derived from the English talent,
a weight two-thirds of the Roman-Alexandrian talent
which was derived from the royal cubit and foot of
ancient Egypt.</p>

<p class='c014'>The original system, of at least ten centuries ago,
was as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Length.</i>—The foot was the measure of the side of
a cubic vessel containing 1000 Roman ounces of
water.</p>

<p class='c014'>The furlong became at a very early period a length
of 40 rods = 220 yards.</p>

<p class='c014'>The mile, originally 5000 Roman feet, became
5000 English feet, divided into 8 road-furlongs.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Surface.</i>—The acre was one-tenth of the square
furlong.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Capacity.</i>—The wine-bushel was the cubic foot, the
measure of 1000 ounces of wine or water. 1/8 of it
was the wine-gallon = 1728/8 or 216 cubic inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The corn-bushel was 1-1/4 cubic feet, the measure of
1000 oz. = 62-1/2 lb. of wheat; 1/8 of it was the corn-gallon
= 270 c.i.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Weight.</i>—The pound was 16 Roman ounces =
6992 grains. Its multiples were the 16-lb. stone, the
wey of 16 stones, and the true cwt. of 100 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>This excellent system has become, after many
disturbances, the Imperial system, only differing from
the old English system in the following points:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. The slight rise of the pound (by 8 grains) to
7000 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>2. The rise of the wine-gallon to 231 c.i. as now
used in America.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The unification of the wine- and corn-gallons (the
latter still used in America at the standard of 268·8
c.i.) in the Imperial gallon = 277-1/4 c.i. = 10 lb. water.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. The fixing of the mile at 8 roods or field-furlongs
of 220 yards.</p>

<p class='c014'>5. The optional decimalisation of several series:</p>

<p class='c024'>(<i>a</i>) Of the furlong at 10 chains, of the square furlong
at 100 sq. chains, and of the acre at 10 sq.
chains.</p>

<p class='c024'>(<i>b</i>) Of weights by the 10-lb. gallon and the 100-lb.
cental.</p>

<p class='c024'>(<i>c</i>) Of the ton-register of 100 cubic feet = 100,000
ounces of water.</p>

<p class='c014'>6. The disappearance of the Troy pound. The Troy
ounce must shortly disappear; the 112-lb. cwt. and
its stone-divisions are optional.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Imperial Standards are now:</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Length.</i>—The Foot, approximately the side of a
cubic vessel containing 1000 ounces of water. The
yard of 3 feet or 36 inches.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Furlong is 220 yards, either—</p>

<p class='c024'>10 chains of 66 feet or 22 yards, or
40 rods of 5-1/2 yards.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Mile is 8 furlongs = 1760 yards.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Nautical mile is 1000 Olympic fathoms =
6080 feet or 2026-2/3 yards.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Surface.</i>—The square furlong is 10 acres; the acre is
10 sq. chains, or 4840 sq. yards, and may be divided
into 160 sq. rods.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span><i>Volume.</i>—The cubic foot is approximately 1000
ounces of water, = 62-1/2 lb. The Ton-register is 100
cubic feet.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Weight.</i>—The pound, of 7000 grains, is divided into
16 ounces of 437-1/2 grains.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Gallon of water weighs 10 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Cental is 100 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Ton is 20 long Cwt. of 112 lb.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Capacity.</i>—The Imperial gallon = 277-1/4 c.i. contains
exactly 10 lb. of water, or approximately 8 lb.
of wheat. It is divided into 8 pints containing 20 oz.
of water or 16 oz. of wheat. The Bushel, of 8 gallons,
contains 64 lb. of wheat.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c016'><sup>[58]</sup></a> The Quarter is 8 bushels,
which is approximately the quarter, either of a
short ton, 20 centals, of wheat, or of a freight-ton
of 40 cubic feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>The principal units, foot, pound, gallon, are
connected by their common origin in the talent of
1000 ounces of water. Corrections are needed for
accuracy since the pound was increased in Elizabethan
times by a little more than 1 per 1000 from its original
Roman standard, and since the bushel and gallon were
increased by 3 per cent. from the original corn-measure
to the Imperial standard.</p>

<p class='c014'>The co-related units, foot, furlong, acre, pound,
gallon, are multiplied and divided by the factors
found by long use to be the most convenient to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>people. When no other influence determines the
secondary units, the usual factor is 8, or its double,
its half, its quarter.</p>

<p class='c014'>Any unit may be decimalised for purposes of
calculation, and several series have alternative decimal
series. Thus—</p>

<p class='c024'>Itinerary and Land measures were decimalised
three centuries ago by the chain-series.</p>

<p class='c024'>The Ton-register of 100 cubic feet, used throughout
the world, has a complete decimal series of
divisions.</p>

<p class='c024'>The pound-gallon-cental series are fully decimalised,
from the 100-lb. cental down to the septem, 1/1000
of a pound.</p>

<p class='c014'>A decimal series of weights from the pound upwards
is perfectly lawful. It may be confidently expected
that it will before long replace for most purposes the
stone and long-hundredweight series imposed in the
fourteenth century, and fought against ever since.</p>

<p class='c014'>Apothecaries’ weight, abolished by the Medical
Council half a century ago, still lingers in the Board of
Trade list of standards. Mint-weight is still on the
Troy system. The half-crown is one grain less than
an Imperial half-ounce. It may be hoped that it,
and other silver coins, will before long be brought
exactly to that standard. Already the bronze penny
is one-third of the Imperial ounce.</p>

<p class='c014'>Further improvements will be made. Some adjustment
of the inconvenient 112-lb. hundredweight
with the cental series, that of our ancient hundredweight,
returned to us from America, will probably be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>effected. In the meantime we know that our system
is progressive.</p>

<p class='c014'>It may not have such a scientific appearance as
that of the metric system. But we must not be
dazzled by the word ‘scientific.’ Our system has its
series related with sufficient exactness to have practically
as much unity as the metric system; and it is
convenient. Let us distinguish between science and
pedantry.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>The Propaganda of the Metric System</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>I have read many books and many articles and letters
in newspapers and scientific periodicals advocating
the compulsory use of the metric system, optional
amongst us since 1897, but which no trade, industry or
profession will adopt, and I have almost invariably
found that the writers knew the metric system imperfectly,
and always that they knew their own very
badly. I have found their advocacy illustrated by
examples of problems in imperial weight and measure
which showed defective instruction in the art of cyphering
and supported by statements which were misleading
and only to be charitably excused on the ground of
ignorance.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c016'><sup>[59]</sup></a> Too often opponents of their propaganda
are sneered at as wanting in scientific knowledge,
business experience, and common sense.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>The propaganda of the metric system is effected,
from abroad by diplomacy, and from within by—</p>

<p class='c014'>1. Calling it ‘antiquated,’ a term which might be
applied to Law, to Religion, to Marriage, to Property,
and other ancient institutions.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. Calling it ‘irrational,’ when it has that great
reason which comes from custom, convenience, improvement
in recent times.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. Calling it ‘unscientific,’ when it joins to popular
convenience the option of decimalisation, whenever
that is found convenient, in addition to the alternate
decimalisation already established in several series.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. Putting forward as current certain weights,
such as the Troy pound, long ago obsolete.</p>

<p class='c014'>5. Putting forward as legal measures trade-units,
such as the cask, the sack, &amp;c., used for convenience
in trade, as much in metric countries as with us.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c016'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>6. Putting forward, as necessary, sums and calculations
which a decently taught schoolboy would
laugh at.</p>

<p class='c014'>7. Ignoring all that is convenient in our system and
all that is inconvenient in the metric system.</p>

<p class='c014'>8. Ignoring the satisfaction of the people of the
United States with our system, even when retaining
the old wine-gallon and corn-gallon.</p>

<p class='c014'>9. Ignoring the resistance of the French people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>to the metric system after a century of education in it
and of police-constraint.</p>

<p class='c014'>10. Urging us to follow the example of other
countries that have adopted it, but omitting to find
out whether the peoples of these countries, from
civilised Germany to barbarous Haïti, use it—so far
as they do use it—otherwise than under compulsion.
It is the governments of these countries, not the people,
that have adopted it, always in the name of Science;
and the day police-pressure were taken off, the old
system would return, or, at the least, the decimal
series would disappear.</p>

<p class='c014'>11. Threatening loss of foreign trade, when our
trade weights and measures are so well understood by
foreign manufacturers and merchants that they
find no difficulty in placing their goods on our
market, and are so well known that many foreign
manufacturers find it impossible to use metric standards,
those of England being alone accepted in most
of the markets to which British manufactures are
exported.</p>

<p class='c014'>12. Calling opponents prejudiced, unprogressive,
unscientific, wanting in business experience and
common sense.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such are the arguments used in the propaganda
of a system which would make much of the past life
of our country unintelligible, send most of its manufacturing
machinery to the scrap-heap, dislocate
trade for years and bring about in our country
the same struggle that is still to be seen in France
between the law and the people.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>The claims of the metric system are exactly on the
same basis as those of the Esperanto language. If the
metric system were made compulsory, an energetic
body of Esperantists might only have to adopt the
metric plan of campaign to get their ‘simple, rational,
scientific and international’ language made first
optional, and then, when it was found that no one
would use it, compulsory, while the use of the antiquated
and unscientific English language would be
forbidden.</p>

<p class='c014'>What will be the result of the conflict between the
two systems prevailing about equally in the greater
part of the Western world? On the one side North
America, the United Kingdom and its colonies in the
Eastern Hemisphere; on the other side the Latin
nations of both hemispheres with the principal Teutonic
nations whose governments have imposed the French
system on them. Russia and several other countries
are awaiting the results of the conflict. But it is a
siege rather than a conflict, for the attack is entirely
from France; and though it has the inherent weakness
of its system being a failure in the country of its origin,
yet the defence has the weakness of its people being so
badly instructed in their system that they cannot repel
the invasion, and have even allowed the enemy to
take up a legal position in their own country. The
colonial policy of England, the simple plan of respecting
custom, of not interfering needlessly, is very different
from that of France. British colonies that were
French or Dutch keep the laws and customs that we
found there, and amongst these their systems of weights
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>and measures. If these were convenient they remained,
trade bringing a gradual adoption of the English system
mixed with local measures; and as these were on a
system more or less common to all the Western nations
before the French Revolution, weights and measures
gradually harmonised. But the policy of France is
distinctly aggressive; its colonies must have French
laws and the metric system, and other countries
also must be induced to abolish their systems and
replace them by the system which a century of
police-action has not succeeded in making the French
people adopt, and which they evade in every possible
way.</p>

<p class='c014'>Why the propaganda of the metric system should
have had any success in England appears a mystery—yet
it is intelligible to anyone who has observed the
contagion of opinions, even the wildest. England
has been fascinated by its presentation as scientific
and international. This is a scientific age, and every
new thing that can be puffed as ‘scientific’ is likely to
take with people unprepared to criticise the science.
I have seen the council of no mean English city
induced by the word ‘scientific’ to vote in favour
of a petition to make the use of the metric system
compulsory; the few members, not one-tenth of the
whole, who dared to oppose the resolution being called
unscientific, unprogressive, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c014'>Repeatedly repulsed, the French siege will not
cease its attacks; England, and America also, must be
prepared to meet them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Although the English-speaking peoples have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>system with which they are satisfied, unfortunately
few know its principles; and, in weights and measures
as in other matters, an inferior article well advertised
supplants an old-established and satisfactory article
that is not advertised. If the French people have
not revolted long ago against the system imposed
on them by the Paris bureaucracy, it is because it is
thoroughly advertised as scientific, international,
and as conquering the world by the superior civilisation
of the French nation. They have been trained to make
almost any sacrifices for the glory of France, and so
long as they can evade the decimal and other inconvenient
portions of the metric system they suffer this
patiently for the satisfaction it gives to their patriotic
feelings.</p>

<p class='c014'>But their government must go on conquering, or
they may strike against a system which brings in no
more glory; as other peoples may when they see that
the English-speaking peoples of the world refuse to be
persuaded into accepting it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here is the weak point of the attack. And when
the English-speaking peoples, those of the British
Empire and America, are as well instructed in their
good system as the peoples of the metric countries are
in the bad system imposed on them (and which they
evade for all the good teaching of it), the assailants
will raise the siege.</p>

<p class='c014'>We could reply: Amend your own system and
make it acceptable to your own people before you
ask us to put aside a system which we find convenient
and which is founded on better principles than ours.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>Our system has been carried to all countries; it is
decimal wherever decimalisation is convenient; its
international unit is the Ton-register of 100 cubic
feet, or 100,000 ounces, as old as the first civilisation
of the world, as the civilisation which established the
Meridian mile used by your seamen as by ours. We
reject an artificial system founded in hatred of the
past, and only kept up in its native country by police-force.
In the name of decimals you want us to
abolish our pound, and use a kilogramme which your
own people will not use. It should be enough for you
that we have given your system a denizenship by the
abuse of which we have been greatly annoyed.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>The Reform of the Metric System</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The defence must be active; then the attack
would cease, and the French people, seeing its failure,
would demand a reform of the system imposed on
them; the other nations suffering under it would
follow their example, if indeed the Teutonic peoples
did not begin the reaction.</p>

<p class='c014'>Modifications would be demanded, rendering the
metric system less inconvenient for manufacturers,
for trade, for the everyday business of life.</p>

<p class='c014'>The metric standards would be retained, but the
decimal system would be optional, left principally for
scientific purposes. The divisions and multiples would
be in harmony with the customs of each people, usually
in sexdecimal series.</p>

<p class='c014'>For France, the <i>système usuel</i> of Napoleon’s compromise
would be revived. Incomplete a century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>ago, it could be rendered complete by the following
arrangement of the metric system, suitable both to
Northern and to Southern France.</p>

<p class='c014'>1. The metre to be divided optionally either into 3
feet of 12 inches, or into 4 spans of 9 inches or 12 digits;
2 metres to be a toise and 10 toises a perch; 100 toises
or 10 perches to be a centenié (furlong) and 800 toises
or 8 furlongs a mile = 1741-3/4 yards. The meridian
mile would be 926 toises or 9-1/4 cables.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. Land to be measured by the square toise, 1/25 of
an are; 1600 square toises to be an arpent of 16
vergées metriques or boisselées, each 10 toises square,
= 4 ares.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The livre, = 500 grammes, to be divided commercially
into 16 ounces of 8 drachms; and for
medicinal purposes, the drachm to be 8 oboles of
8 grains. Grammes and decimal fractions of a
gramme could be used for scientific purposes.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. The hectolitre would be divided sexdecimally,
into 4 boisseaux, of 4 gallons = 6-1/4 litres. The litre
would be divided into 2 setiers or chopines, 4 half-setiers,
and 32 ounces.</p>

<p class='c014'>The equivalence with imperial measures would be
approximately:</p>

<p class='c014'>Similar arrangements could be made in other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>countries, the units being made in accordance with the
old custom of the people, but always on a metric basis
so that international conversion of measures would be
easy and accurate.</p>

<h3 class='c019'><span class='sc'>Envoi</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>With this suggestion of compromise, of <i>entente
cordiale</i>, instead of constant aggression by the French
system against that of the British dominions and
America, I close the last chapter of my work. I took
to it twelve years ago for useful occupation in the
leisure of approaching retirement from active life in a
great seaport. But as I carried out my design I found
the verge of the wide subject recede with every advance
I made; every fresh field I worked showed another
field beyond. A renewal of life for study, travel, observation,
would be needed to enable me to carry out at
all completely this history of the human mind in one
of its most interesting and important aspects. But
age warns me to bring my work to a close, leaving its
correction and completion to younger men. Yet I hope
I have been able to show the principles of unity and of
diversity; and apparent confusion becomes clear when
the keys of metrology are at hand. The trend of the
human mind is always the same; for weights and
measures are a part of the daily life of every man and
woman. The rise of measurement, the naturalisation
of weights and measures brought by commerce, even
by conquest, when they are found convenient, the
varieties caused by changes of circumstance, the deflections
under the constraint of ill-advised rulers, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>effect of long custom in reconciling to new standards
if they can only be arranged conveniently, the shifts
by which they can be made endurable, the tendency
to resume the old trend along another path—all these
traits of human nature are shown in this study. One
thing is certain, that a wise government sanctions the
measures which fit its people; its business is to maintain
unity in the inevitable variety; and it should
distrust the pretensions of science to dictate to men
and women, to trade and manufacturers, the measures
they shall use. Whether in theocratic ancient Egypt
or in revolutionary modern Europe, science is a good
servant of Humanity, but a bad master.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
